Kaak Dela? I deeply appreciate your love, affection, and the time you have taken to be here. I have not come here alone; I have brought much with me. I have brought the essence of India's soil, the love of 140 crore countrymen, and their heartfelt good wishes for you. It gives me immense pleasure that my first interaction with the Indian Diaspora, after being elected for the third time, is happening here in Moscow. Friends, Today is July 9th, marking exactly one month since I took the oath. One month ago, on June 9th, I was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India for the third consecutive term, and on that day, I made a commitment. I vowed that in my third term, I would work with triple the strength and triple the speed. It is also noteworthy that the number three features prominently in many of our government's goals. Our goals include making India the world's third-largest economy in this term, constructing three crore houses for the poor, and creating three crore 'Lakhpati Didis'.\u00a0 Perhaps this term is new to you. Women Self Help Groups are active in villages across India. We aim to empower them significantly, focusing on skill development and diversification. In my third term, our goal is for three crore sisters from impoverished rural areas to achieve prosperity\u2014meaning their annual income should exceed one lakh rupees, sustained indefinitely. This is a formidable target, yet with the support and blessings of friends like you, even the loftiest goals become attainable. You are all aware that modern India consistently meets its objectives. India has achieved remarkable feats, such as sending Chandrayaan to the moon, leading in secure digital transactions globally, and implementing pioneering social sector policies. Moreover, India boasts the world's third-largest startup ecosystem today. When you entrusted me with the opportunity to serve our nation in 2014, there were only a few hundred startups; today, there are lakhs. India is now breaking records in patent filings and research publications, showcasing the immense talent and strength of our youth\u2014an achievement that has captivated the world. Friends,\u00a0 The world is amazed at the pace of development India has achieved in the past decade. Visitors to India often remark on the country's transformation\u2014recognizing new constructions and significant changes taking place. When India successfully hosts events like the G-20 summit, the world acknowledges India's evolving stature. The rapid doubling of India's airports in just ten years and the electrification of over 40,000 kilometers of railway lines further underscore India's capabilities, leaving a lasting impression globally of India's transformation. Today, as India sets new benchmarks in digital payments, accomplishes the orbit of the sun from the L-1 point, builds the world's tallest railway bridge, and erects the world's tallest statue, it is evident to all observers that India is truly changing. This change is driven by India's belief in the strength of its 140 crore citizens, both at home and abroad. India is proud of its people and their collective aspiration to transform into a developed nation. This commitment is visible in the diligent efforts of every farmer, every youth, and every underprivileged individual across the nation. Today, my fellow Indians reside in various corners of the globe. Each of you carries immense pride in your homeland's accomplishments, holding your heads high. When discussing India with your foreign friends, you enthusiastically enumerate the country's achievements, and they listen attentively. Let me ask you plainly: is what I'm saying true? Don't you? Do you feel proud? Has the world's perception of you changed? This affirmation comes directly from 140 crore fellow citizens. Today, all 140 crore Indians are committed to resolving long standing issues. My friends, our nation does not evade its challenges. Today, all 140 crore Indians are tirelessly preparing to excel in every domain. You have witnessed how we not only revived our economy from the Covid crisis but also positioned it among the strongest globally. We are not merely addressing infrastructure deficiencies; we are setting global benchmarks. It's not just about enhancing healthcare services; we're ensuring free treatment for every underprivileged person through the world's largest health assurance scheme, Ayushman Bharat. This scheme is the largest of its kind worldwide. How is all of this possible,\u00a0friends? Who is driving this change? Once again I reiterate, it is the tireless efforts, dedication, and devotion of our 140 crore citizens and their dreams, resolutions, and diligent endeavours for success. Friends, The transformation in India extends beyond its systems and infrastructure; it is also evident in the self-assurance of every citizen, particularly the youth. As you know, self-confidence is the crucial first step toward success. Before 2014, we were engulfed in despair; frustration had taken hold. Today, however, the nation is brimming with self-confidence. Consider two patients with the same illness in a hospital, attended by equally competent doctors. One patient exudes confidence while the other is consumed by despair. It's often observed that the confident patient recovers swiftly and leaves the hospital within weeks, whereas the patient in despair requires assistance. Present-day India exemplifies this self-assurance, which stands as our greatest asset. You recently celebrated our victory in the T-20 World Cup, and I'm certain you celebrated it here too. Did you? Were you proud? The tale of triumph in the World Cup reflects a journey of resilience. Today's youth in India refuses to accept defeat until the final ball, embodying the spirit where victory crowns those unwilling to yield. This attitude resonates not only in cricket but across all sports. In recent years, our athletes have achieved historic feats in international competitions. A formidable team is now gearing up from India for the upcoming Paris Olympics, poised to showcase their prowess. This confidence in India's youth is our true capital, harbouring the potential to propel India to new heights in the 21st century. Friends, You must have observed the election atmosphere and likely tuned into the news to stay updated on the latest developments\u2014seeing who is saying what and who is doing what. Friends, During the elections, I often remarked that the development achieved by India in the past decade is merely a trailer. The next decade promises even faster growth. From semiconductors to electronics manufacturing, green hydrogen to electric vehicles, and world-class infrastructure, India's accelerated pace will script a new chapter in global development. I say this with utmost responsibility. Currently, India contributes 15% to global economic growth, a figure set to increase significantly in the years ahead. India will lead the charge on global poverty and climate change challenges, as confronting challenges is ingrained in my DNA. Friends, I am delighted. This camaraderie is the essence, where there's no gap between the leader and the people, where the leader's thoughts resonate with those of the people. This alignment generates tremendous energy, which is what I am witnessing now, friends. Friends, I am delighted that India and Russia are collaborating closely to invigorate global prosperity. Each of you present here is elevating the relationship between our nations to new heights, contributing to Russian society through your hard work and integrity. Friends, I have long been an admirer of the special bond between India and Russia. When we hear the word Russia, every Indian immediately thinks of our partner in joy and sorrow, our trusted friend. Our Russian friends call it \"Druzhba,\" and in Hindi, we call it 'Dosti' (friendship). Despite the severe winters in Russia, the warmth of India-Russia friendship has always remained strong and positive. This relationship rests on a solid foundation of mutual trust and respect, as echoed in the famous song that used to resonate in every household here: \"Sir pe lal topi russi, phir bhi? phir bhi? phir bhi? Dil hai hindustani...\" Though this song may be old, its sentiments are timeless. In the past, legends like Mr. Raj Kapoor and Mr. Mithun Da enriched the cultural ties between India and Russia through their artistry. Our cinema has played a crucial role in deepening this bond, and today, each of you is further advancing the India-Russia relationship to new horizons. Our friendship has withstood numerous tests, emerging stronger each time. Friends, I must especially commend the leadership of my dear friend President Putin for nurturing this enduring friendship between India and Russia over more than two decades. I have visited Russia six times in the last decade, meeting President Putin on 17 occasions during these years. Each meeting has strengthened our mutual trust and respect. When our students faced difficulties during conflicts, President Putin extended his assistance in safely returning them to India. I extend my heartfelt gratitude once again to the people of Russia and my friend President Putin for this support. Friends, Today, a significant number of our youth come to Russia for their studies. I hae been informed that there are associations representing various Indian states here, which preserve the diversity of festivals, cuisine, languages, songs, and music from each region. You celebrate every festival here, from Holi to Diwali, with great enthusiasm. India's Independence Day is also marked with fervour and I anticipate this year's celebration on August 15th to be even more spectacular. Last month, thousands also participated in International Yoga Day here. What's heartening for me to see is our Russian friends joining you with equal enthusiasm in these celebrations. This people-to-people connection transcends government initiatives and is indeed a tremendous strength. And friends, Amidst this positive environment, I am pleased to share another piece of good news with you. You may be wondering what it is. It has been decided to establish two new consulates in Kazan and Yekaterinburg. This step will facilitate easier travel and promote business opportunities between our nations. Friends, A symbol of our bilateral relations is the India House in Astrakhan, where traders from Gujarat settled in the 17th century. I visited there during my early tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat. Two years ago, Astrakhan received its first commercial consignment from the North-South Transport Corridor, linking the port cities of Mumbai and Astrakhan. Presently, efforts are underway for the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor. Both our nations are rediscovering each other through the Ganga-Volga Dialogue of Civilization. Friends, When I visited here in 2015, I stated that the 21st century would belong to India. I asserted it then, and today the world echoes this sentiment. There is now unanimous agreement among global experts on this matter. Everyone affirms that the 21st century belongs to India. Today, as a global sibling, India is instilling fresh confidence in the world. India's burgeoning capabilities offer the world hope for stability and prosperity. India is recognized as a robust pillar in the emerging multipolar world order. When India advocates peace, dialogue, and diplomacy, the world pays heed. In times of crisis, India is often the first to extend assistance, and it remains committed to meeting global expectations. For a long time, the world has witnessed an influence-driven global order. Today's world seeks confluence, not influence. Who can comprehend this better than India, a nation that reveres gatherings and confluences? Friends, All of you serve as India's brand ambassadors in Russia. Those who are on mission are 'Rajdoots' (ambassadors) and those who are outside the mission are 'Rashtradoots' (also ambassadors). Your efforts are instrumental in strengthening the relationship between Russia and India. Friends, It is noteworthy that a government in India has been elected for a third consecutive term after 60 years. However, during these elections, all attention, all cameras were focused on Modi, diverting attention from many other significant events. For instance, elections were also held in four states during this period\u2014Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Andhra Pradesh, and Odisha\u2014all of which were won by the NDA with clean sweep majorities. Currently, the auspicious pilgrimage of Mahaprabhu Jagannath ji is ongoing\u2014Jai Jagannath. Odisha has witnessed a remarkable transformation, which is why today I am also wearing an Oriya scarf among you. Friends, May the blessings of Mahaprabhu Jagannath Ji be upon all of you, and may you enjoy good health and prosperity... With this heartfelt wish, I extend my sincere thanks to each one of you! This is the tale of eternal love, my friends. It will continue to flourish day by day, turning aspirations into commitments, and with our diligent efforts, every goal will be accomplished. With this conviction, I once again convey my deepest appreciation to you all. Repeat after me - Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Bharat Mata Ki Jai! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Vande Matram ! Thank you very much! DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM\u2019s speech.

It brings us great joy to see how you have filled the country with enthusiasm and celebration. You have exceeded the hopes and desires of all our countrymen. My heartiest congratulations to you all! Usually, I work late into the night at the office, but this time the TV was on, and I found myself unable to concentrate on my files. You demonstrated remarkable team spirit, talent, and patience. I could see your patience; there was no rush. You were full of immense self-confidence. So, once again, my heartfelt congratulations to all of you, my friends. Rahul Dravid: First of all, I want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to meet you. When we lost that match in Ahmedabad in November, you came to support us even during those difficult times. We are delighted to meet you today on this joyous occasion. Rohit and all the boys have shown tremendous fighting spirit and a never-say-die attitude in many matches. Reaching the finals itself is a testament to their hard work and resilience. It is heartening to see how these boys have inspired the younger generation. They have grown up watching the victory in 2011, and I am confident that their performance has inspired many young boys and girls in our country across all sports. So, I want to thank you, and I extend my congratulations to these boys. Prime Minister: Congratulations to you all. You have much to offer the youth of our country in the coming times. You have given them victory, but you can also inspire and guide them in many ways. You now possess a certain authority. Why is Chahal so serious? Am I right? Anyone from Haryana finds happiness in every situation and everything. Rohit, I want to hear your thoughts on this moment. The ground could be anywhere, the soil could be of a different nation but the essence of cricket is on the pitch. And you kissed that essence of cricket, something only an Indian can do. Rohit Sharma: I just wanted to cherish that moment of victory forever and taste it (the soil). Winning on that pitch meant everything to us because we had waited so long and worked so hard for it. Many times, the World Cup came close, but we couldn\u2019t seize it. This time, however, we achieved it thanks to everyone\u2019s efforts. That pitch held great significance for me because it was where we accomplished our dreams. It spontaneously happened at that moment. The whole team worked incredibly hard, and that hard work finally paid off on that day. Prime Minister: Every citizen of the country must have noticed it, but Rohit, I observed two extremes. I could see the emotions involved and the way you danced when you went to take the trophy. Rohit Sharma: Sir, the reason behind it was that it was such a significant moment for all of us. We had all been waiting for this for many years. The boys told me not to just walk up, but to do something different. Prime Minister: So, was this Chahal's idea? Rohit Sharma: Chahal and Kuldeep... Prime Minister: Well! Your journey of recovery has been difficult. As a player, it was likely your asset (self-confidence) that helped you to keep going. But recovering at such a time must have been challenging. I remember you made many social media posts; my colleagues used to tell me about them\u2014how much you had recovered each day. Rishabh Pant: First of all, thank you for inviting us here. The thought behind this, Sir, is that I had an accident 1.5 years ago, and I was going through a tough time. I remember it well because you called my mother, Sir. A lot was going through my mind, but when you called, my mother told me that you had said everything would be fine. That helped me relax mentally. During my recovery, people would say they weren't sure if I would be ever allowed to play cricket again. Especially with wicketkeeping, they would say, \"He's a batsman so he might still be able to bat, but will he be able to do wicket keeping?\" For the last 1.5 to 2 years, I was determined to return to the field and perform better than before\u2014not to prove it to anyone else, but to myself. I had to dedicate myself to playing international cricket again and to help bring victories to India. Prime Minister: Rishabh, when you were recovering, I spoke to your mother and told her two things. First, I had consulted with the doctors and asked them to inform me if you were required to be treated abroad. They assured me they would consider it. But what truly surprised me was your mother's firm belief. Although I had never met her, she conveyed a sense of assurance during our conversation. It was remarkable. I felt that with such a supportive mother, you would never fail. This thought came to my mind then, and you have proved it right. The most striking thing I noticed when talking to you was your refusal to place blame on anyone else; you said it was your fault. This level of accountability is exceptional, as many would have made excuses. Your openness to life is commendable, and I learn from observing such details; I try to learn from everyone, friends. Your patience and resilience are extraordinary, reflecting a divine connection. It is truly inspiring for the nation in general and for the players in particular. I understand how tough wicket keeping training is, standing for hours holding your thumb. But you have overcome that challenge brilliantly. Congratulations to you. Rishabh Pant: Thank you, Sir. Prime Minister: There are ups and downs, but prolonged perseverance pays off at the right time. Your dedication to Cricket has shown its true colours when needed. Virat, this time your journey was full of ups and downs. Virat Kohli: First of all, thank you very much for inviting us here. This day will always remain in my memory. Throughout the tournament, I couldn't contribute as much as I wanted to, and at one point, I even told Rahul bhai that I felt I had not done justice to myself or the team. He assured me that when the situation demands it, I would perform. This had been our conversation. When we went to the field, I confided in Rohit that I lacked confidence due to my performance in the tournament and I wasn't sure if I would be able to perform up to my expectations. However, after hitting three fours in the first four balls, I felt a surge of confidence. I told him, \"What a game this is; One day you feel you won't be able to score a single run, and the next day, everything clicks.\" Especially when our wickets started falling, I realised I had to completely surrender to the situation; I had to focus solely on what was important for the team at that moment. I was completely absorbed in the situation. I felt, I was pushed into that zone. I was into that moment. And later, I understood that whatever is supposed to happen, it happens. It was bound to happen. From the situation we won the final, we lived each and every single delivery towards the end. From the point where the final turned around. What was going through us, we cannot explain.\u00a0At one point, we had lost hope, but then Hardik took a wicket, and our energy built up again, ball by ball. I am happy that I could contribute on such a significant day for the team after a challenging period. The entire day and the way we won will remain unforgettable. I am just glad that I could help the team reach a position where we could strive for victory. Prime Minister: Everyone felt it, Virat. Your total was stuck at 75, and then it suddenly moved to 76. These things happen sometimes. Everyone believes you will do it, and that belief becomes a driving force. But what was your family's immediate reaction when you were stuck at 75? Virat Kohli: The good thing, Sir, was the time difference, so I didn\u2019t talk to my family much. My mother tends to worry a lot. But the main issue was that despite my efforts, things weren\u2019t working out. When you try so hard and think you will succeed, sometimes your ego gets in the way, and the game slips away from you. I needed to let go of that and focus on the team. Like I said, the situation of the game was such that there was no room for my ego. Once I respected the game, it respected me back that day. That was my experience, Sir. Prime Minister: Many congratulations to you. Prime Minister: Paaji... Jasprit Bumrah: No sir, whenever I bowl for India, it's often during crucial stages, whether it's with the new ball or... Prime Minister: Do you go to the field after having Idlis? (laughter) Jasprit Bumrah: No, no, Sir. Whenever the situation is tough, I\u2019m called on to bowl and I feel happy when I\u2019m able to help the team get through the tough overs. It gives me a lot of confidence, I carry that confidence throughout my overs. In this tournament, there were a lot of situations where I was supposed to bowl the tough overs and I could help the team and help win the matches. Prime Minister: From what I\u2019ve observed, once a batsman reaches the 90s, no matter the mood for victory, they become noticeably more serious. Similarly, in the last over, when the outcome hinges on a single ball, the tension must be immense. How do you handle yourself in such moments? Jasprit Bumrah: If I start thinking about 'what if we lose?' or if I try to do something extraordinary, I\u2019ll get nervous and likely make mistakes. If I focus on the crowd or other people, I might slip up. So, in those moments, I centre my attention on myself and what I can do. I recall past instances when I have performed well and helped the team. I try to remember those experiences and give my best by drawing on them. Prime Minister: But this must be very stressful, my friend. A day without paranthas will feel incomplete! Jasprit Bumrah: No sir, in the West Indies, we didn\u2019t get to have idlis or paranthas. We managed with whatever was available. The scenario was good, though. We were travelling back-to-back, and as a team, the tournament went very well. We won the World Cup for the first time, and I had never experienced such emotions before. I feel very proud and have never felt better than this. Prime Minister: You have done a great job. The nation is proud of you. It makes us proud. Prime Minister: Yes, Hardik, tell me. Hardik Pandya: First of all, Sir, thank you for inviting us. As I mentioned during the interview, the last six months have been quite eventful for me, with many ups and downs. When I went to the ground, the public sometimes booed, and many other things happened. I always believed that I should respond through my game, not with words. I was speechless then, and I am speechless now. I always believed in fighting, never leaving the field, because life shows both difficulties and successes. I believed, Sir, that I would stay, work hard, and with the support of the team, players, captain, and coach, I was well-prepared. God blessed me with the opportunity in the last over. Prime Minister: That over of yours became historical, but what did you say to Surya? Hardik Pandya: When Surya caught the catch, our first reaction was to celebrate. Then we realised we should check if Surya was alright. We confirmed he was fine and celebrated again. He had caught a game-changing catch, and our tension turned into joy. Prime Minister: Yes, Surya? Suryakumar Yadav: I am overwhelmed, Sir! At that moment, I was only focused on catching the ball. I wasn\u2019t thinking about whether I would catch it or drop it, just about pushing it in to save runs. The wind was blowing, and once it came into my hand, I threw it in but I saw that Rohit was far away. So I caught it again. We have practised these situations a lot. I always thought about one thing that I contribute in batting but how else could I contribute? So I felt that I needed to contribute to the team in fielding too. Prime Minister: Do you practice catching the ball this way? Rahul Dravid: Surya has taken 185, 160 such catches in practice. Prime Minister: Really? Suryakumar Yadav: Yes, Sir. Since the start of the tournament and after coming back from the IPL, I have practised many such catches. I didn't know that God would give me the opportunity to catch one in such a crucial moment. But I was calm because I had faced this situation before during my practice. However, there were more people in the stands this time. It felt great to be in that moment. Prime Minister: I must commend you... the entire country was tense with the ups and downs, and then a sudden turn of events! The situation changed entirely. This is significant, and if it becomes a part of your life, you are indeed very lucky, my friend. Suryakumar Yadav: I feel like I've earned another star, Sir. I\u2019m feeling elated. Prime Minister: Many congratulations to you! Suryakumar Yadav: Thank you, Sir! Prime Minister: Your father's statement has been widely discussed across the country. When asked, his answer was very touching. He said, \"First the country, then my son.\" This is truly remarkable! Yes, Arshdeep, please share your thoughts. Arshdeep Singh: Sir, thank you for giving me the opportunity to meet you. I am feeling great about the cricket match! I feel very proud that we have won this tournament. As I mentioned earlier, it feels great to bowl alongside Jassi bhai. He puts a lot of pressure on the batsmen, and they often try to take risks against me, which allows me to take wickets. The other bowlers have also performed exceptionally well, so I was enjoying it as I was getting the wickets as a result of that. So I feel the credit goes to the whole team. Prime Minister: When Axar used to play in school, I once had the chance to give him a prize. Axar Patel: That was in the 8th standard. Prime Minister: I have no personal connection with the world of sports, but whenever there is any significant event in sports, I find myself getting involved. Axar Patel: That catch was crucial because their partnership was strong. A wicket fell in the first over, but none after that. When Kuldeep was bowling, the wind was blowing in the direction I was standing. I thought it would be an easy catch, but the ball started moving quickly with the wind. Initially, I planned to catch it with my left hand, but then I realized it was going to my right hand. I jumped and, when I felt the ball in my hand, I realised I had caught it. Most of the time, such catches are missed, but I was lucky to secure it at that crucial moment in the World Cup, just when the team needed it. Prime Minister: So, the Amul milk is working, it seems? (laughter) Kuldeep Yadav: Thank you so much, Sir. Prime Minister: Should we call you Kuldeep or Deshdeep? Kuldeep Yadav: Sir, I am first and foremost from my country, so obviously, Sir, I enjoy playing all matches for India. It makes me very proud. My role in the team is as an attacking spinner. I always bowl in the middle overs, and the captain and coach's plan is always for me to take wickets during that period. The fast bowlers give us a good start by taking one or two wickets, making it a bit easier to bowl in the middle overs. I am feeling very good. Having played in three World Cups, it was a great opportunity, and I am very happy to have lifted the trophy, Sir. Prime Minister: So, Kuldeep, how dare you make the Captain dance? Kuldeep Yadav: I didn't make the Captain dance! Prime Minister: (Laughter) Kuldeep Yadav: When Rohit told me that we should be doing something (celebration act), I made a suggestion, but he did not do it the way I told him.. Prime Minister: So, is there a complaint? Prime Minister: The youngest player in 2007 and now captain of the victorious team in 2024... What has your experience been like? Rohit Sharma: Sir, to be honest, when I first joined the team in 2007, we toured Ireland where Rahul Bhai was the captain. After that, we went straight to South Africa for the World Cup. We won the World Cup there. When we returned to India, it took us five hours to reach Wankhede Stadium from the airport as all the Mumbaikars were on the street. At that time I thought winning the World Cup was easy. Over the years, we often came close but couldn't win the World Cup. For this World Cup, I can confidently say there was a lot of desperation and hunger among the team players. When we went to the West Indies, there were many challenges, especially as cricket was being played in New York for the first time, and the practice grounds were not good. But none of the boys focused on that; they were solely focused on how to play the final in Barbados. It feels great to captain a team with such a united goal of 'how to win?' Seeing so many smiles on people's faces, carrying the Indian flag and walking on the streets late into the night, brings immense joy. Our aim is to inspire the next generation, just as Rahul Bhai, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, and Laxman inspired us. We have a responsibility to pass on that inspiration, and with this World Cup victory, I am sure the coming generation will have that enthusiasm. Prime Minister: Rohit, are you always so serious? Rohit Sharma: Sir, actually, only the boys can tell you that. Prime Minister: Congratulations on winning all the matches! This time, even the participants were more, with many new countries joining in. In cricket, those who play often don't realise the enormity of their achievements because they are continuously working hard. The impact on the country is significant, but Indian cricket has a unique characteristic. India's cricket journey has been incredibly successful, and it has started to inspire other sports as well. Athletes in other sports now think, \"If something like this can happen in cricket, why can't it happen in our sports?\" This is a tremendous service being done through you. To advance ourselves and the country, we must cultivate the same spirit in all sports, aiming to raise the glory of our flag worldwide. Today, talent is being discovered throughout the country, from small villages and tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Previously, talent mostly came from big cities and major clubs, but now, more than half of your team members come from smaller places. This is the true impact of victory, and its effects are long-lasting. The statement from the Afghanistan Minister was very interesting. Afghanistan had got the opportunity to play with South Africa. It was a successful journey for them but they gave the credit to India. Afghanistan's Minister credited India for Afghanistan's cricket progress, saying that the Indians prepared their players. Prime Minister: You all have made Rahul 20 years younger. Rahul Dravid: No, the credit goes to these boys. I had been a player and a coach. So, I always say that we can only support them. I haven't scored a single run, taken a single wicket, or caught a single catch in this tournament. We have a whole support staff team, including other coaches, who work very hard. And we all can only support the team. In pressure situations, when players like Virat, Bumrah, Hardik, or Rohit have to perform, we can only support them and provide whatever they need. but they are the ones who actually perform in the field. The credit goes entirely to them. I am extremely grateful and delighted that they gave me such a wonderful experience. The team spirit in this tournament was excellent.\u00a0Even among the eleven players who played, four boys were sitting out. Mohammed Siraj played the first three matches, but in the USA, we played with an extra fast bowler. So, he played only three matches in the tournament. Three boys in our team didn't play a single match: Sanju, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Yashasvi Jaiswal. Despite not playing, they maintained great enthusiasm and never looked down. They never felt demoralized. This was very important for us and our team. So, this attitude was crucial for our team, and I greatly praise their spirit. Prime Minister: I appreciate that as a coach, you pay attention to the entire team. Anyone who hears your words will realise that even those not seen on the field contribute significantly. Such a strong team spirit is essential for success. But Rahul, I would like to know your thoughts on the 2028 Olympics in the USA, where cricket has now been included. I believe that more attention will be focused on the Olympics than the World Cup. If the Government of India, the Cricket Board, or you as individuals were to prepare for the Olympics, what would your reaction be? Rahul Dravid: Definitely Modiji, playing in the Olympics is not an opportunity that cricketers have traditionally had, as cricket will be included in the Olympics for the first time in 2028. I think this will be a monumental event for the country, the cricket board, and the players themselves and we must perform well. As you mentioned earlier, it's an excellent chance for us to stand alongside other sports, where so many great athletes bring immense pride to our nation. The Olympics is such a prestigious event, and having cricket included is a matter of great pride for the sport. I am confident that whoever is on the board at that time, our BCCI, will make thorough preparations for the tournament. I hope many of the boys from this team, including young players like Rohit and Virat, will participate. Prime Minister: Yes, there will be many new faces by 2028! Rahul Dravid: Indeed, by 2028, we will see many new players. I am hopeful that our team will work hard and aim for gold, which would bring immense joy and happiness. Prime Minister: I understand that seeing tears of joy after a victory also makes one realise how tough the moments of defeat must have been. People often cannot fathom the pain a player endures during those moments of loss, having come so far and then falling just short. The joy of victory highlights how arduous the journey through defeat must have been. I witnessed all this firsthand and felt confident that you would overcome it. Today, I see that you have indeed done it. Congratulations to all of you! DISCLAIMER: This is the approximate translation of PM\u2019s speech.

Rajaraman yesterday. The Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister, while addressing investors and market participants, in IFSC on 9 th December, 2023, had said: \u201c During our G-20 presidency, one of our priorities was to understand the need for sustainable finance to ensure global growth and stability. This would contribute to the transition towards greener, resilient, and inclusive societies and economies. According to some estimates, Bharat would require at least USD 10 trillion by 2070 to achieve the Net Zero Target. Financing from global sources is essential for this investment. Hence, we aim to make IFSC a global hub for sustainable finance. GIFT IFSC serves as an efficient channel for the necessary flow of green capital to build a low-carbon economy in Bharat. The development of financial products such as green bonds, sustainable bonds, and sustainability-linked bonds will make the path and access easier for the entire world .\u201d Consequently, the Expert Committee on Climate Finance was constituted by IFSCA on 21 st December 2023, to provide a roadmap for IFSCA to develop a climate finance ecosystem and instruments at GIFT IFSC with a special focus on Transition Finance as well as to provide recommendations on establishing the GIFT-IFSC as a global hub for climate financing. The Committee is chaired by Shri. Dhruba Purkayastha (Director-Growth and Institutional Advancement, Council on Energy, Environment and Water) and includes experts across policy think tanks, standard setters, consultants, industry, and global financial institutions. The Report on Transition Finance captures the recommendations by the Expert Committee under three pillars: 1. Scope and definition of Transition Finance, 2. Policy and Regulation, 3. Financial Mechanisms and Instruments. It emphasises the role of transition finance in driving investments towards hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement, shipping, fertilisers etc. which are crucial for economic growth of India and other developing nations. The report offers strategic recommendations to IFSCA and policy makers by exploring global best practices and regulatory landscapes, to enhance the role of GIFT-IFSC as a gateway for attracting international climate capital flows in order to achieve India\u2019s ambitious goal of achieving net-zero by 2070.\u00a0\u00a0 IFSCA will commence work on a framework for Transition Finance based on the report. The report and the detailed recommendations of the Expert Committee can be accessed on IFSCA website at https://shorturl.at/EqhIG . The Committee is expected to continue its work and draft its next report on \u201c Transforming GIFT-IFSC into a Climate Finance Hub \u201d.\u00a0 **** NB/KMN (Release ID: 2030330) Visitor Counter : 2216 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

{"title": "Principal Scientific Adviser to GoI launches report on e-mobility R&D roadmap for India to achieve net-zero targets", "date_posted": "Posted On: 16 JUL 2024 4:04PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Office of Principal Scientific Advisor to GoI Principal Scientific Adviser to GoI launches report on e-mobility R&D roadmap for India to achieve net-zero targets Posted On: 16 JUL 2024 4:04PM by PIB Delhi The \u201c e-mobility R&D Roadmap for India \u201d report was launched by Professor Ajay Kumar Sood, Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India today (July 16, 2024) at Vigyan Bhawan Annexe in New Delhi. The R&D roadmap has been prepared after detailed horizon scanning of the global automotive sector and identifying future cutting-edge technological requirements. It categorizes research projects into four important areas: Energy Storage Cells, EV Aggregates, Materials and Recycling, Charging and Refueling, and provides clear pathways to attain global leadership by being Atmanirbhar in the next five years. (Launch of e-mobility R&D Roadmap for India) The official launch event, held in hybrid mode, was attended by government officials, members of the Consultative Group on e-Mobility (CGeM), representatives from industry and think tanks, and members of the press and media. Dr. Parvinder Maini, Scientific Secretary, Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, Dr. Reji Mathai, Director General, Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), Pune, Dr. K. Balasubramanian, Director, Non-Ferrous Materials Technology Development Centre (NFTDC), Hyderabad among others participated in the event. (E-Mobility R&D Roadmap for India Report Launch underway) In his opening address, Prof. Sood highlighted that India aims to achieve a 45% reduction in emission intensity by 2030 and energy independence by 2047 to reach net-zero commitment by 2070. A significant part of this vision will require the wider adoption of electric vehicles, manufacturing of indigenous energy storage systems, and generation of renewable energy to feed charging infrastructures. He said that p resently the e-mobility value chain heavily depends on imports. Prof. Sood emphasized on reducing our dependence on imports within the e-mobility value chain and the requirement of strengthening domestic R&D capabilities in the automotive sector. Dr. Preeti Banzal, Adviser, Office of PSA presented a brief overview of the Office\u2019s significant efforts toward creating a strong R&D ecosystem in the automotive sector. She informed that the Office of PSA, in August 2022, had constituted a 'Consultative Group on eMobility (CGeM)', which is a panel of experts from government, academia, and industries to devise technical roadmaps, studies, documents for accelerating migration of prevalent fossil fuel-based transportation sector towards electric mobility in India. The roadmap document has been prepared by ARAI under the overall guidance of CGeM. Prof. Karthick Athmanathan, PSA Fellow and Professor of Practice, IIT Madras, presented a summary of the e-mobility R&D roadmap for India. He explained how the DST White Paper has successfully addressed the actions needed to get out of the current import-dependent situation and how this roadmap helps avoid a similar situation arising in the future as technologies are developed over time. Prof. Athmanathan indicated that the research projects have been identified by the experts on both Technology deployment and Market leadership as the primary objective. Priority for research projects was assigned based on their potential impact on achieving national energy independence, the feasibility of implementation within the set timelines, market dominance, and their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and resources. After the presentations, the Chair opened the sessions for questions and answers from members of the press and media.\u00a0 It emerged that the e-mobility R&D roadmap charts a course towards future independence and self-sufficiency, outlining critical research initiatives that will position India as a leader in the global value and supply chains within the next five to seven years. This roadmap aims to fill critical gaps in the current research and development framework. While many identified projects are yet to achieve global success, some areas already demonstrate significant international accomplishments where India is yet to commence preparations. These projects are included to establish a strong foundation for the country to pursue future innovations in those areas when opportunities arise. In his concluding remarks, Prof. Sood said that the automobile sector in India is one of the largest contributors to the country's GDP and, considering its fast growth trajectory, it will continue to do so in the future. He emphasized that this progress should be aligned with the Net-Zero vision of the country and there is an impending need to foster a culture of R&D and innovation-driven growth in the automotive sector.

About Aspirational Districts and Blocks Programme The Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP) covering 112 Districts was launched in the year 2018 to ensure the speedy development of the relatively backward and remote areas of the country. ADP has had a measurable and tangible impact on improving key indicators that uplift the lives of its citizens. Building on the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP), the Aspirational Blocks Programme (ABP) was launched by the Hon\u2019ble PM in 2023 and aims for the saturation of essential government services in 500 Blocks across the country in multiple domains such as health, nutrition, education, drinking water and sanitation, agriculture, water resources, financial inclusion, and basic infrastructure. \u00a0 \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Aspirational Districts Programme \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Aspirational Blocks Programme \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Launched in January 2018 by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Launched in January 2023 by Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Aims to quickly and effectively transform 112 districts across the country \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Aims for saturation of essential government services in 500 Blocks (329 Districts) across the country \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Focuses on five themes: \t\t\t \t\t\t\t Health & Nutrition \t\t\t\t Education \t\t\t\t Agriculture & Water Resources \t\t\t\t Financial Inclusion & Skill Development \t\t\t\t Infrastructure \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Focuses on five themes: \t\t\t \t\t\t\t Health & Nutrition \t\t\t\t Education \t\t\t\t Agriculture and Allied Services \t\t\t\t Basic Infrastructure \t\t\t\t Social Development \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Progress in measured on 81 indicators of development \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Progress is measured on 40 indicators of development \t\t\t Block Profile can be accessed from here . \t\t\t \t\t \t ****** DS/SR (Release ID: 2030418) Visitor Counter : 8660 Read this release in: Bengali , Telugu , Malayalam , Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Nepali , Marathi , Manipuri , Assamese , Punjabi , Gujarati , Tamil , Kannada", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/SampoornataAbhiyanFinalLogo-01LYL0.jpg"]},

The Report extensively analyses India\u2019s electronics sector, emphasizing its potential and challenges. It also outlines specific interventions needed for India to emerge as a global manufacturing hub for electronics. Global Value Chains (GVCs) are critical in modern manufacturing, involving international collaboration across design, production, marketing, and distribution. They represent 70% of international trade, highlighting India\u2019s urgent need to enhance its participation, especially in electronics, semiconductors, automobiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. Electronics, in particular, is pivotal, with 75% of its exports originating from GVCs. India\u2019s electronics sector has experienced rapid growth, reaching USD 155 billion in FY23. Production nearly doubled from USD 48 billion in FY17 to USD 101 billion in FY23, driven primarily by mobile phones, which now constitute 43% of total electronics production. India has significantly reduced its reliance on smartphone imports, now manufacturing 99% domestically. Initiatives like Make in India and Digital India, improved infrastructure and ease of doing business, supported by various incentives, have stimulated domestic manufacturing and attracted foreign investments. Despite these strides, India\u2019s electronics market remains relatively moderate, accounting for only 4% of the global market, which has so far focussed primarily on assembly, with limited capabilities in design and component manufacturing. The global electronics market, valued at USD 4.3 trillion, is dominated by countries like China, Taiwan, USA, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia. India currently exports approximately USD 25 billion annually, representing less than 1% of the global share despite\u00a0 4% share in global demand. To enhance competitiveness, India needs to localize high-tech components, strengthen design capabilities through R&D investments, and forge strategic partnerships with global technology leaders. The current value of India\u2019s electronics production stands impressively at USD 101 billion as of FY 23. This figure comprises USD 86 billion in finished goods production and USD 15 billion in components manufacturing. During the same period, exports totalled ~USD 25 billion, reflecting India's increasing role in the global electronics market. As regards domestic value addition, the sector has also contributed ranging between 15% to 18%, and has generated approximately 1.3 million jobs. In a Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, projections indicate that India\u2019s electronics manufacturing could escalate to USD 278 billion by FY 30. This forecast includes USD 253 billion from finished goods and USD 25 billion from components manufacturing. Employment generation is expected to grow substantially to around 3.4 million, with exports reaching USD 111 billion. However, India's ambition to become the third-largest global economy necessitates a more ambitious vision for its technology-driven sectors . With a conducive business environment and robust policy support, including fiscal incentives and non-fiscal interventions, India should aim to achieve USD 500 billion in electronics manufacturing by value terms by FY 30 . This ambitious target comprises USD 350 billion from finished goods manufacturing and USD 150 billion from components manufacturing. Such growth is projected to create employment for an estimated 5.5 million to 6 million people , significantly boosting job opportunities across the country. Electronics exports are expected to reach USD 240 billion and domestic value addition to increase to more than 35%. In parallel, the strategy emphasizes scaling up production in established segments such as mobile phones and establishing foothold in component manufacturing . Additionally, there should be a strong focus on diversifying into emerging areas such as wearables, IoT devices, and automotive electronics . This strategic diversification will\u00a0 capitalize on evolving consumer demands and technological advancements, positioning India as a leader in innovative electronic products on the global stage. The report recommends strategic interventions across fiscal, financial, regulatory, and infrastructure domains to support this ambitious growth trajectory . These include promoting components and capital goods manufacturing, incentivising R&D and Design,\u00a0 tariff rationalization, skilling initiatives, facilitation of technology transfers, and infrastructure development to foster a robust electronics manufacturing ecosystem in India . India possesses immense potential to establish itself as a global leader in electronics manufacturing . By capitalizing on emerging opportunities, enhancing value chain integration, and overcoming existing challenges, India can transform its electronics sector into a cornerstone of economic growth and job creation.

The SEHER program was launched by Ms. Anna Roy, Mission Director, Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) and Principal Economic Adviser, NITI Aayog in the presence of Mr. Jitendra Asati, Director (Financial Inclusion), Department of Financial Services (DFS), Ministry of Finance; Mr. Sunil Mehta, Chief Executive, Indian Banks\u2019 Association (IBA); Mr. Neeraj Nigam, Executive Director, Reserve Bank of India (RBI); Ms. Mercy Epao, Joint Secretary, Ministry of MSME; and Mr. Rajesh Kumar, MD and CEO at TransUnion CIBIL. Ms. Anna Roy, Mission Director, WEP, and Principal Economic Adviser, NITI Aayog, explained, \u201cA lack of financial awareness is often cited as one of the key roadblocks for MSME development, which is a high priority segment for our country's economic growth. To get timely and better access to finance for business growth, entrepreneurs must gain knowledge on all aspects of finance, including their CIBIL Rank and commercial credit report. WEP aims to empower women entrepreneurs by overcoming information asymmetry and providing support across different pillars such as entrepreneurship promotion, access to finance, market linkages, training and skills development, mentoring and networking, and access to business development services.\u201d Mr. Rajesh Kumar, MD and CEO, TransUnion CIBIL added: \u201cTransUnion CIBIL is proud to partner with the Women Entrepreneurship Platform on this unique initiative aimed at empowering women entrepreneurs across socio-economic categories, age-groups and geographic locations. Business growth is directly dependent on credit access, credit awareness and financial literacy. We aim to propagate financial knowledge and improve the skills of women entrepreneurs so that they can manage their businesses successfully to achieve sustained growth. This program will also help support India\u2019s USD 5 trillion economy goal as more and more women are empowered to start and grow their businesses profitably.\u201d Supporting and accelerating women-owned businesses and entrepreneurship According to the Udyam Registration Portal (URP) of the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), India has 63 million micro, small, and medium enterprises of which 20.5% are women-owned, employing as many as 27 million people. The Ministry also reported that rural areas have a slightly greater share of women-owned enterprises (22.24%) compared to urban areas (18.42%). Estimates suggest that by accelerating women's entrepreneurship, India could create more than 30 million new women-owned enterprises, potentially creating 150 to 170 million more jobs \u2013 with women-owned businesses\u2019 contribution to employment generated by URP-registered units at 18.73%. TransUnion CIBIL data insights indicate that demand for business loans by women has grown 3.9X in the last five years (FY 2019 \u2013 FY 2024). A marked 10% growth in the share of number of women borrowers holding a business loan was seen during this period. Of the 1.5 crore borrowers with a live business loan in March 2024, 38% were women. The portfolio balance for business loans by women borrowers grew at 35% CAGR during the same period (March 2019 to March 2024). Across other products such as agri-business loans, commercial vehicle, and commercial equipment loans, the share of women borrowers has remained constant at 28% (March 2019 to March 2024), as per the TransUnion CIBIL consumer bureau data. As women-led businesses are growing across geographies, empowering them with quick, easy and cost-effective access to finance is paramount for the sustained growth of their businesses. With a focus on credit education, SEHER will offer women entrepreneurs access to personalized resources and tools, including financial literacy content. WEP and TransUnion CIBIL are committed to working together in promoting financial and credit awareness by educating women entrepreneurs across the country about the importance of building a good credit history and CIBIL score to avail easier and faster access to finance.

The Index was launched by Shri Suman Bery, Vice Chairperson, NITI Aayog in the presence of Shri B. V. R. Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog; Shri Shombi Sharp, UN Resident Coordinator in India; Dr. Yogesh Suri, Senior Advisr, NITI Aayog and Ms. Isabelle Tschan Harada, Deputy Resident Representative, UNDP. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 SDG India Index 2023-24 measures and tracks national progress of all States and UTs on 113 indicators aligned to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation\u2019s (MoSPI) National Indicator Framework (NIF). The SDG India Index computes goal-wise scores on the 16 SDGs for each State and UT. Overall State and UT scores or Composite Scores are generated from goal-wise scores to measure the aggregate performance of the sub-national unit based on its performance across the 16 SDGs. These scores range between 0\u2013100, and if a State/UT achieves a score of 100, it signifies it has achieved the targets. The higher the score of a State/UT, the greater the distance covered to the target. India's commitment to the SDGs since adopting the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development is reflected in concerted efforts on SDG localisation spearheaded by NITI Aayog, which works closely with States and UTs. NITI Aayog has the twin mandate to oversee the adoption and monitoring of the SDGs in the country and promote competitive and cooperative federalism among States and UTs. Together with States and UTs, NITI Aayog has focused on the institutionalisation of the SDGs \u2013 not only to look at sustainable development as a standalone or parallel framework, but also to make them an integral part of national and subnational thinking about development through institutional ownership, collaborative competition, capacity development, and following a whole-of- society approach. The launch of the SDG India Index in 2018 provided the impetus for the localisation push, reaffirming States and UTs as key stakeholders in this transformative journey. The SDG India Index has been consistently improved over the years to provide a comprehensive and comparative analysis of progress on the goals. By fostering collaborative competition, the Index not only highlights achievements, but also encourages States and UTs to learn from each other to close outcome-based gaps. Grounded in the globally accepted SDSN methodology, the development of the Index followed extensive consultations with the States and UTs (the primary stakeholders); MoSPI; Union Ministries; and UN agencies. The Index represents the articulation of the comprehensive nature of the Global Goals under the 2030 Agenda while being attuned to the national priorities. \u00a0 Key highlights and results from the fourth edition of the SDG India Index: \t The composite score for India improved from 57 in 2018 to 66 in 2020-21 to further to 71 in 2023-24 \u00a0 \t India has taken significant strides in accelerating progress on the SDGs between the 2020-21 and 2023-24 editions of the Index. Noteworthy advancements have been observed in Goals 1 (No Poverty), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), 13 (Climate Action). These are now in the 'Front Runner' category (a score between 65\u201399). \u00a0 \t Among these, Goal 13 (Climate Action) has shown the most substantial improvement, with its score increasing from 54 to 67. Goal 1 (No Poverty) follows closely, with its score rising significantly from 60 to 72. The progress underscores the effects of the focused programmatic interventions and schemes of the Union and State Governments in improving the lives of citizens. \u00a0 \t Since 2018, India has witnessed substantial progress in several key SDGs. Significant progress has been made in Goals 1 (No Poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). \u00a0 \t Government's focus on ensuring food & nutrition security, health, education, electrification, housing for all, sanitation, clean cooking fuel & energy has significantly contributed to the improvements.\u00a0 \u00a0 \t Key interventions facilitating SDG achievements include: \t \t\t Over 4 crore houses under the PM Awas Yojana (PMAY), \t\t 11 crore Toilets & 2.23 lakh Community Sanitary Complexes in rural areas \t\t 10 crore LPG connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, \t\t Tap water connections in over 14.9 crore households under\u00a0 Jal Jeevan Mission \t\t Over 30 crore beneficiaries under Ayushman Bharat -Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana \t\t Coverage of over 80 crore people under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) \t\t Access to 150,000 Ayushman Arogya Mandir which offer primary medical care and provide affordable generic medicines \t\t Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of \u20b934 lakh crore made through PM-Jan Dhan accounts. \t\t The Skill India Mission has led to over 1.4 crore youth being trained and upskilled and has reskilled 54 lakh youth \t\t PM Mudra Yojana sanctioned 43 crore loans aggregating to \u20b922.5 lakh crore for entrepreneurial aspirations of the youth besides Funds of Funds \t\t Start Up India and Start Up Guarantee schemes assisting the youth \t\t The Saubhagya scheme for access to electricity \t\t Emphasis on renewable energy resulted in an increase in solar power capacity from 2.82 GW to 73.32 GW in the past decade. \t\t Between 2017 and 2023, India has added around 100 GW of installed electric capacity, of which around 80% is attributed to non-fossil fuel-based resource. \t\t Improvement in digital infrastructure with reduced internet data costs by 97% which has in turn positively affected and fostered financial inclusion \t \t State and UT results \t The SDG India Index 2023-24 reports a positive trend in the performance of States and UTs in their SDG journey. The scores for States now range from 57 to 79, while UTs score between 65 and 77. This represents an improvement over the 2020-21 scores, where the range was 52 to 75 for States and 62 to 79 for UTs. \u00a0 \u00a0The performance of State and UTs in terms of their overall score is given below: \u00a0 \t The Index records a significant increase in the number of States and UTs achieving Front Runner status. This year, 32 States/UTs have scored between 65 and 99, up from 22 in the 2020-21 edition. Notably, there are 10 new States and UTs in the Front Runner category. These include Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu. \u00a0 \t The SDG India Index 2023-24 demonstrates the increase in composite scores across all States, with improvements ranging from 1 to 8 points. Leading the way in terms of score improvement are Assam, Manipur, Punjab, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir, each achieving a positive change of 8 points since the 2020-21 edition. \u00a0 \t Progress on the SDGs over the last four editions of the Index: \u00a0 \u00a0 \t Index methodology : \t \t\t The methodology of the Index involves a series of steps. The first step consists of compiling raw data for the selected indicators and identifying data gaps (if any). Subsequently, target values for 2030 are established for each indicator, providing clear benchmarks for evaluating progress. The raw data is then normalised, transforming it into a score ranging from 0 to 100. The Goal score for each SDG is computed by taking the arithmetic mean of the normalized scores of its relevant indicators. The composite SDG India Index score is derived as an average of all Goal scores. The index and indicators are updated incorporating the latest developments in data availability. \t\t Goal 14 has not been included in the calculation of the Composite Score for the Index as it solely pertains to the nine coastal States. \t \t \u00a0 \t The SDG India Index 2023\u201324 is also live on an online dashboard.

Addressing the gathering, Dr. Mandaviya said \u201cIndia is full of diversity and potential. There has never been a shortage of brainpower, manpower, or talent in India. Not just the cities, but even in our far-flung areas like the North-East, Coastal, Himalayan and tribal areas can have a quality sportsperson there. KIRTI is aimed at spotting these talented athletes and develop their skills\u201d. \u201c Our Hon\u2019ble PM Narendra Modiji has repeatedly stressed on the importance of sports in our life. With a vision to make India a global sports superpower, the Government has taken active steps to wholeheartedly support the talented athletes.\u00a0 The focused approach of the Government is reflected in our enhanced medals tally in recent years at various global championships including the Olympics. We need to have a steady stream of these high-performing assets and that\u2019s where KIRTI, a stepping stone to sporting excellence, comes into play,\u201d said Dr. Mandaviya. Speaking to the thousands of young school-going children who attended the launch event, Dr Mandaviya said, \u201cAmong you, there will certainly be an Olympic champion. I appreciate the fact that your parents have come and are backing you to play sports\u201d. Maybe one day when you will win an Olympic medal, you or your parents will remember this day at the JLN Stadium, Union Minister added. Dr. Mandaviya further said that the Government has decided to identify 1 lakh budding young athletes within 100 days under the KIRTI programme. He further mentioned that, under the KIRTI programme, everyone will be given opportunities to develop their sports skills, whether they live in a village or a city, and whether they come from a poor background or otherwise. Today\u2019s event marked the start of a nationwide talent hunt which will prove to be a stepping stone to making India one of the top 5 nations in the Olympic Games by 2047. Interestingly, out of the 117 athletes representing India in the Paris Olympics this year, 28 have emerged from the Khelo India ecosystem. KIRTI\u2019s talent identification model has been scientifically planned using IT tools and global best practices. The KIRTI program aims to bridge this gap and provide direction to young budding athletes to choose a career path based on their abilities. Project KIRTI with its decentralized and pocket-based talent identification approach seeks to achieve the twin objectives \u2013 mass participation and excellence in sports. The plan for the KIRTI program is to complete over 1 lakh assessments within 100 days at 100 locations emphasizing its commitment to accelerating talent identification and development and later scaling up operations to conduct 20 lakh assessments within a year. \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0927\u093e\u0928\u092e\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 @NarendraModi \u091c\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u0928\u0947\u0924\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u092e\u0947\u0902, \u0939\u092e \u0916\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u094b \u0915\u0940 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092d\u093e \u0915\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u094d\u0939\u0947\u0902 \u0909\u0924\u094d\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0930\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e \u0905\u0935\u0938\u0930 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u093e\u0928 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092c\u0926\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u0948\u0902\u0964 \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u092e\u093f\u0932\u0915\u0930, \u0939\u092e \u090f\u0915 \u0910\u0938\u0947 \u0930\u093e\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0902 \u0916\u0947\u0932 \u0914\u0930 \u0916\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0906\u0917\u0947 \u092c\u0922\u093c\u0947\u0902 \u0914\u0930 \u0909\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u091a \u0939\u094b\u0902\u0964 pic.twitter.com/lFLhwGHPUs \u2014 Dr Mansukh Mandaviya (@mansukhmandviya) July 19, 2024 In Delhi, Sports Authority of India in collaboration with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) shall conduct KIRTI assessments of over 25000 MCD students in a total of 12 zones.

These efforts encompass a variety of initiatives and programs designed to enhance the training, preparation, and overall performance of Indian athletes on the global stage. \u00a0 \t Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) The Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) is a flagship program aimed at providing targeted assistance to potential Olympic medalists. TOPS offers support in several key areas: \t Training and Camps : National Coaching Camps and international training sessions. \t Foreign Exposure : Opportunities for athletes to compete and train overseas. \t Specialized Support : Hiring of foreign experts, coaches, and support staff. \t Equipment and Facilities : Provision of necessary sports equipment and training facilities. \t Financial Assistance : Direct funding to cover various aspects of athletes' preparation.

The agreement signed today has transpired from these conversations.

The experience of the two sides coming together helps us make these models significantly more holistic as now Innovation & Entrepreneurship meets Intellectual Property (IP) in a serious way.\u201d The WIPO delegation is on a 4 day visit to India, and will take part in a workshop on Intellectual Property in Innovation organised at AIC GGSIPU, Dwarka, on 23 rd July.

In his inaugural address to the Principal Secretaries, Secretaries, Directors and officials of State Tribal Welfare Departments, Secretary (Tribal Affairs) Shri Vibhu Nayar reiterated the need to address the challenges in four key areas of tribal development - health, livelihood, education, and forest rights - and to chalk out a roadmap for Vision 2047. Thematic workshops on Forest Rights Act, Livelihoods, Scholarships, PM JANMAN, EMRS, Health and TRI Projects were held as part of the Manthan Shivir. The participants\u00a0 brainstormed on ways to build a robust response mechanism and address bottlenecks in the implementation of existing schemes. P articipants discussed ways to achieve harmonisation of scholarship schemes, and deliberated on bio-authentication as a means to prevent fraudulence. They deliberated on ways to address pendency of claims, create area maps, and foster the spirit of entrepreneurship among the tribals. Best practices from model cases provided food for thought. On Day 2, the participants put their heads together on how to revamp the PM JANMAN scheme, how to create an action plan for training of EMRS school teachers, and how to spread awareness about Sickle Cell Disease at the National, State and grassroots level on a war footing as well as other initiatives being planned by the Ministry. Other points of discussion were: \t Progress of PM JANMAN with focus on MPC, Vandhan\u00a0 Kendra and Model villages \t PM GatiShakti Portal-Progress tracking and physical verification at grassroots level Support and assistance for CSC household survey \t Data validation by DC/DM and approval by PS (TWD) on PM GatiShakti portal \t Expediting MPC construction works and inauguration of completed MPCs \t Installation of Public app by DC/DM and posting content at hyperlocal level \t Initiatives planned under PM JANMAN2/Homestay \t Revamping of Ashram Schools Representatives from BISAG (Bhaskaracharya National Institute for Space Application and Geo-informatics) shared the know-how to use mobile application for capturing household data in door-to-door surveys in order to ensure that all the family members of a household can avail scheme benefits under PM JANMAN and allied benefits. Plenary sessions were held at the close of each day, where the ideas churned out at the thematic workshops were collated and brought to the discussion table. The participants had much to learn and share in terms of increasing efficiency of data collection, optimisation of resources and liaising with state departments and non-governmental organisations to achieve the stated goals. ***** VM (Release ID: 2034555) Visitor Counter : 1357 Read this release in: Tamil , Urdu , Hindi , Marathi , Manipuri", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/Screenshot2024-07-201052365CNC.png"]},

(25th PM-STIAC Meeting Underway) Along with the PM-STIAC members, the meeting brought together key government officials and industry players to discuss robust policy formulation for effective Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) in India. They discussed the reports prepared by inter-ministerial technical committees constituted by NITI Aayog\u2019s Advisory Committee on developing a policy framework for implementing CCUS initiatives in India. The meeting also discussed India\u2019s carbon market and carbon credit scheme to reduce emissions, pursue a low-carbon path, and provide market support f or mit igation methods and technologies. India has set a target to achieve a 45% reduction in emission intensity by 2030 and is aiming for Net Zero by 2070. This makes CCUS one of the important measures to achieve decarbonization from the hard-to-abate sectors. The meeting was joined by Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member S&T, NITI Aayog , Scientific Secretary Dr. Parvinder Maini, Office of the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India and the Secretaries of all relevant departments including Secretary (Power) Shri Pankaj Agarwal; Secretary (Department of Chemicals and Petrochemicals) Ms. Nivedita Shukla Verma; Secretary (Earth Sciences) Dr. M Ravichandran; Secretary (Coal) Shri Amrit Lal Meena; Chairman (Indian Space Research Organisation) Dr. S. Somanath; Chairman (Defence Research and Development Organisation) Dr. Samir V Kamat; Secretary (Biotechnology) Dr. Rajesh Gokhale; and Secretary (Department of Health Research) Dr. Rajiv Bahl. Representatives from the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Ministry of Steel, and the National Council of Cement and Building Materials also participated in the meeting. In his opening address, Prof. Sood highlighted the government's prioritisation of CCUS as a solution for CO2 emission reduction. He discussed the opportunities for widespread adoption and large-scale deployment of CCUS technologies, focusing on economic feasibility, supportive policy measures, institutional arrangements, and technological feasibility for installing CCUS projects in industries like Power, Iron & Steel, Cement, and Chemicals. He also emphasized the role of carbon markets in promoting CCUS by exploring options such as pricing on carbon emissions and driving investments in emission reduction technologies among others. \u00a0 (PSA Prof. Sood delivering opening remarks) Dr. V.K. Saraswat, Member S&T, NITI Aayog noted that technical committees were established by NITI Aayog for adopting CCUS technologies. He highlighted the need for prioritizing R&D, regulatory framework and the way forward to large-scale capacity plants. He asserted the significance of the carbon credit market, suggesting measures such as incentivization to industry to foster its development. Additionally, Dr. Saraswat recommended that hub and cluster approach may be adopted for development of the CCUS ecosystem in the country. The first session of the meeting commenced with the presentation by Mr. Rajnath Ram, Advisor/Head, Energy, NITI Aayog outlining the findings of the inter-ministerial technical committees\u2019 reports on four identified areas of CO2 capture; CO2 utilisation; CO2 transportation and storage; and safety and technical standards development. He highlighted the need for the formulation of the CCUS policy framework in India. It was followed by presentations by industry experts on synthesizing a complete CCUS value chain in the Indian context and the efforts of power generation companies to promote CCUS in India. Representative from the Department of Science and Technology and Dr. Vikram Vishal, Professor, Department of Earth Science, IIT Bombay presented the various initiatives in the R&D sector of the CCUS landscape. They highlighted the R&D interventions and the Government of India\u2019s support aimed at promoting CCUS in India. In the second session, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency presented on the Indian carbon market and carbon credit scheme. After the presentations, the Chair invited interventions from the representatives of the inter-ministerial technical committees. It was discussed that there is a need to identify adoptable technologies and life-cycle assessment of CCUS projects. It was also discussed that while standards for carbon capture and storage are in place, standards for carbon utilisation and transportation are being developed. Thereafter, Secretaries and representatives of ministries gave their inputs on how various ministries and departments of Government of India can work together to address this important issue. It was suggested that a national portal for CCUS projects may be developed to bring all stakeholders on a common platform. During their interventions, the PM-STIAC members emphasized the need for institutional mechanisms for CCUS R&D, implementation, and policy framework. Further, community awareness and outreach for CCUS were emphasized. The need for mapping of emission data was also discussed. \u00a0 (Group Photo on 25th PM-STIAC Meeting) In his concluding remarks, Prof. Sood emphasised the need to foster nationwide adoption of CCUS technologies and take this initiative forward through a mission-mode approach.

This report is the outcome of extensive analysis of India\u2019s electronics sector including its scopes and challenges. The report lays down the roadmap for the country to become a global manufacturing hub in electronics manufacturing. In the current scenario, 70% of international trade comprises Global Value Chain (GVC) items emphasizing the critical need for India to enhance its GVC participation. This can be achieved by prioritizing sectors such as electronics, semiconductors, automobiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, which play a significant role in the GVC landscape. Within GVCs, the electronics sector holds a significant position as nearly 80% of electronics exports come from GVCs. In the financial year 2023, India\u2019s electronics sector recorded a significant value of exports, contributing a considerable share of 5.32% to India\u2019s total merchandise exports. The sector\u2019s export performance highlights its competitiveness in the global market and its ability to capitalize on international demand. It has also enhanced India\u2019s position in the global electronics landscape. The electronics sector is very high in terms of GVC participation. It is not confined to a particular country or economy and is spread across several geographies and firms. Presently, India\u2019s electronics manufacturing primarily involves the final assembly of electronic goods. While brands and design firms have started increasingly outsourcing assembly, testing, and packaging tasks to Electronic Manufacturing Services (EMS) companies in India, the ecosystem for design and component manufacturing is at a nascent stage. The manufacturing sector will play a crucial role in India's journey towards becoming Viksit Bharat. It can be achieved by accelerating Make-in-India by engaging in Global Value Chains. With this perspective, NITI Aayog will release a comprehensive report on the subject suggesting a roadmap for country for becoming manufacturing powerhouse in the electronics sector. *** DS/SR (Release ID: 2033821) Visitor Counter : 3331 Read this release in: Telugu , Kannada , Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Marathi , Punjabi , Gujarati , Tamil", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

The aim is to create awareness about outreach and the efficacy of JSS in creating self-employment and wage employment opportunities among socio-economically backward groups through skill development training. Moving beyond traditional skills, the conference also emphasized on the relevance of futuristic, industry-relevant skills and their role in better preparing individuals for the evolving job market. The Minister also inaugurated the exhibition of products made by JSS candidate from Delhi and UP and interacted with beneficiaries. The Jan Shikshan Sansthan (JSS) Scheme, originally launched as Shramik Vidyapeeth (SVP) in 1967, is a transformative initiative designed to provide skill training through registered Societies (NGOs) with full funding from the Government of India. This pioneering scheme targets non-literates, neo-literates, individuals with rudimentary education, and school dropouts up to class 12th, aged 15-45 years. By offering flexible, affordable, and accessible skill training, JSSs have become a lifeline for women, Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), minorities, and other disadvantaged groups in society. Currently, over 290 JSSs are functional in 26 States and 7 UTs including 47 in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 3 in Delhi. Since the transfer of the scheme from the Ministry of Education (Erstwhile MHRD) to MSDE in July 2018, a total of 26.37 Lakh beneficiaries have been trained under the JSS scheme. The qualified beneficiaries consist of educationally disadvantaged and economically backward groups in rural and urban slums. In line with the key objectives of the scheme, many trained beneficiaries are women 21.63 Lakh (82.02%). Speaking on the progress, Shri Jayant Chaudhary, Minister of State (Independent Charge), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE), said that the M inistry is dedicated to providing better opportunities for the youth. He asserted that under Jan Shikshan Sansthan, the aim is to enhance capacity building and expand skill development opportunities among low-income groups. While applauding the Jan Shikshan Sansthan, for recognizing the skilled workforce gap in various sectors and acting as a bridge builder, connecting talent with opportunity, he also said that the process of skilling, reskilling, and upskilling are essential for personal and economic growth. Shri Jayant Chaudhary also informed that the PMKVY scheme has already benefited over 97,000 people from Meerut and 1.4 crore individuals across India. He further said NAPS (National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) apprenticeship program plays a vital role in encouraging the employees to enhance their skill to match the ever-evolving industry requirements. Shri Atul Kumar Tiwari, Secretary, Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Government of India, applauded the outstanding work of JSS in empowering the low-income communities in India. He said through the strong community connections, JSS has been training the youth, especially women, in industry-relevant skills like marketing to not only increase their employability but also to bring about their holistic empowerment. He encouraged them to continue this invaluable work and promote strong livelihood opportunities. Shri Kapil Dev Aggarwal, MoS (IC), Vocational Education and Skill Development Department, Govt. of UP. Member of Legislative Assembly from Muzaffarnagar Constituency, said honorable Prime Minister of India\u2019s focus on skill development is unwavering. He added that the Prime Minister consistently highlights the crucial role skilling playing in the growth of the nation. He also highlighted the role of National Education Policy 2020 in vocational training and urged everyone to embrace it across levels from secondary education to high degrees. He also acknowledged JSSs' remarkable work in making skilling available to low-income groups and wished that the young generation adopt vocational studies and become job providers from job seekers for a better tomorrow. A key strength of the JSS Scheme lies in its community connect and the involvement of local administration, village functionaries, and other stakeholders. This ensures effective mobilization of infrastructure, resources, and beneficiaries, enabling them to seek various job opportunities in various industries such as food processing, textile, IT, and more. Additionally, JSSs conduct activities to raise awareness on critical social, economic, health, financial literacy, and environmental issues. The Zonal Conference served as a platform for sharing best practices, addressing challenges, and strategizing for the future. These conferences aim to enhance the implementation and outreach of the JSS Scheme, ensuring it continues to empower the targeted communities effectively. In the previous financial year, the Ministry conducted Zonal Conferences from 13th March to 22nd March, 2024, at four diverse locations: Hyderabad, Goa, Udaipur, and Guwahati. These conferences reviewed the performance of JSSs and gathered valuable feedback and suggestions for improving the scheme's outcomes. **** SS/AK (Release ID: 2032606) Visitor Counter : 604 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Punjabi , Tamil", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

The event brought together key stakeholders, representatives from various government ministries, departments, shipping operators and PSU/ private sector shipyards to discuss strategies for revitalizing the shipbuilding and repair ecosystem within India and aligning it with India's ambitious Maritime India Vision 2030 (MIV 2030) and Amrit Kaal Vision 2047 . \u2018\u2019Under the leadership of Hon\u2019ble Prime Minister, India is set to become a global economic superpower, with a robust maritime sector playing a crucial role in this journey. Atma Nirbharta emphasize self-reliance, extending to the shipping and shipbuilding industries. Despite efforts and developments in port infrastructure and inland waterways, we remain dependent on foreign vessels and have yet to capture a significant share of the global shipbuilding market. Recognizing this, the Ministry is now focusing on enhancing our shipbuilding, and ship repair infrastructure to meet the ambitious goals of MIV 2030 and MAKV 2047. Through this interactive workshop, MoPSW aims to present specific policies based on stakeholder inputs and invite further valuable contributions to drive demand and capacity growth in these sectors\u2019, Shri TK Ramachandran, Secretary of MoPSW. The presentation made by the Ministry highlighted the growing trend of the Indian overseas and coastal cargo, while at the same time highlighting that the share of the cargo carried by Indian owned/ flagged vessels has been dropping over the past decade and presently stand at only about 5.4%. If there is no initiative undertaken, then this share may fall further, resulting in Indian owned/ Indian built ships having no play even in India\u2019s own shipping market. Furthermore, owning of the fleet needed for national trade brings with it several key advantages in terms of availability of fleet in times of crisis, protection against embargos and protection of India\u2019s valuable foreign exchange reserves which is presently being spent on chartering and freight management charges to foreign nations. At the same, time, if the tremendous demand stemming from the needs of the Indian shipping market are adequately targeted by Indian shipyards, it may result in an opportunity to the extent of over USD 237 billion (~INR 20 lakh crores) by 2047. The workshop was attended by more than 100 participants from 50 organisations including various government ministries, departments, shipping operators and PSU/ private sector shipyards. Viz., Ministry of Defence; Ministry of Coal; DG Shipping, Shipyards Association of India; National Centre of Excellence in Green Port and Shipping; Royal IHC Netherland; HPCL; Indian Oil Corporation Limited; GAIL; Garden Reach Shipyard; Indian National Ship Owners\u2019 Association; Hindustan Shipyard Limited; Ministry of Petrol and Natural Gas; Dredging Corporation of India Limited etc. \u00a0The idea of the event was to bring the demand generators and the suppliers/builders onto a collaborative common platform to formulate ideas to ensure that the large demand from the Indian shipping industry may become opportunities for the Indian shipbuilding industry. In the event, the stakeholders deliberated upon the limitations of Indian shipyards, the incentives needed, both on supply and demand sides and the assistance that could be provided by the MoPSW to facilitate the same. The inputs and insights that have been received from the distinguished voices of the Industry were noted and the Ministry hopes to address the various issues that were raised, incorporate them into their 100 days agenda and suitably help develop and nurture the ecosystem and achieve the ambitious targets of MIV 2030, of making India one of the top 10 ship building nations by 2030, and one of the top 5 countries in shipbuilding by 2047.\u00a0 In the past, MoPSW has endeavored to aid the growth of shipbuilding and ship repair industry through schemes such as Shipbuilding Financial Assistant Policy, Right of First Refusal (ROFR) policy, according Infrastructure status to shipyards, etc. Despite these measures, commercial shipbuilding in India, has still not reached a position of strength compared to global shipbuilding majors, accounting for less than 1% of the global shipbuilding market, largely on account of lack of demand. Consequently, MoPSW is examining the policy measures to strengthen demand creation domestically given our requirement to strengthen our domestic fleets. Notable advancements made in the development of indigenous low-emission or zero-emission ships/vessels by Indian shipbuilding companies showcase our potential to lead the world in safe sustainable and green shipbuilding. MoPSW is working on an integrated approach to bringing together shipbuilding stakeholders through the development of Maritime Clusters. Aligning with the Maritime India Vision 2030 (MIV 2030) and the Amrit Kaal Vision 2047, the workshop emphasized the importance of these visionary frameworks in driving India's maritime growth. MIV 2030 has set a bold target to elevate India's global ranking in shipbuilding and ship repair from over 20th place to the top 10 and an ambitious goal has been set for the top 5 position, as outlined in the Amrit Kaal Vision 2047. Another major target under MAKV 2047 is handling 1300 MMTPA of coastal cargo carriage and greater proportion of Indian overseas cargo to be carried out on Indian owned/ Indian built ships. To achieve these targets MoPSW seeks to Develop capabilities and evolve sector to global competence; Adopt global best practices, processes and technologies foreign; Protect exchange reserves; Drive Industry sustainability and green initiatives; Expand shipbuilding capacity. This strategic vision reflects the government's commitment to transforming India into a global maritime powerhouse. This ambitious goal is part of a comprehensive strategy to enhance the country's maritime infrastructure and capabilities. \u00a0 MJPS (Release ID: 2030843) Visitor Counter : 1959 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image001VG1L.jpg", "https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image0022SGQ.jpg", "https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image0037P2I.jpg", "https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image004TYS7.jpg", "https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image005H7BM.jpg"]},

Metal oxide photocatalysis offers a sustainable solution for removing organic pollutants from water bodies. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), zinc oxide (ZnO), and tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) are notable catalysts due to their high surface area and stability. When exposed to light, they generate electron-hole pairs that degrade pollutants into harmless by-products. Factors affecting efficiency include choice of metal oxide, crystal structure, light parameters, pollutant concentration, pH, and catalyst loading. Optimizing these factors is crucial for maximizing degradation rates. Dr. Arundhuti Devi and her team at Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), an autonomous institution of the Department of Science and Technology (DST) have developed an innovative metal oxide nanocomposite for photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. Ni-doped TiO 2 on Fuller\u2019s earth (NiTF) was characterized and tested as a photocatalyst for methylene blue decolorization. It achieved 96.15% decolorization of dye solution at pH 9.0 under visible light for 90 minutes. Fuller\u2019s earth improved TiO 2 adsorption in the dark, suggesting cost-effective environmental photocatalysts. This work was recently published in the journal Elsevier (Inorganic Chemistry Communications ). The nanocomposite prepared can have potential applications in catalysis, energy storage, sensors, optoelectronics, biomedical fields, coatings, and renewable energy production through water splitting. \u00a0 Publication link, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inoche.2023.110550 \u00a0 For further correspondence: Dr. Arundhuti Devi arundhuti@iasst.gov.in Figure: Schematic representation of the photocatalytic degradation pathway. *** PK/PSM (Release ID: 2030073) Visitor Counter : 3406 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi_MP , Hindi , Tamil , Telugu", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image001QD60.jpg"]},

{"title": "Scientists propose a new measure of flexibility for crystals", "date_posted": "Posted On: 03 JUL 2024 4:20PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology Scientists propose a new measure of flexibility for crystals Posted On: 03 JUL 2024 4:20PM by PIB Delhi Researchers have carried out an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms underlying the flexibility of crystals of Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and attributed the flexibility to large structural rearrangements associated with soft and hard vibrations within a crystal that strongly couples to strain fields. The analysis opens doors to innovative materials with diverse applications in various industries. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a large class of crystalline materials which possess the remarkable ability to absorb gases, such as carbon dioxide, and store them as well as act as filters for crude oil purification. MOFs derive their ability from the presence of nanopores, enhancing their surface areas that, in turn, make them adept at absorbing and storing gases. However, limited stability and mechanical weakness have hindered their broader applications. Addressing this issue, Professor Umesh V. Waghmare from the Theoretical Sciences Unit at Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, (JNCASR) Bengaluru (an autonomous institution under the Department of Science & Technology, Govt. of India) and his team recently introduced a novel quantitative measure of mechanical flexibility for crystals that can be used to screen materials database to identify next-generation flexible materials. Their paper, \u201c Quantifying the intrinsic mechanical flexibility of crystalline materials \u201d, presents groundbreaking insights on the origin of mechanical flexibility and was published in the journal Physical Review B . In particular, the focus of Prof. Waghmare\u2019s research lies with MOFs, which are known for their beautiful crystalline structure and large flexibility. Historically, flexibility in crystals has been assessed in terms of a parameter called elastic modulus, which is a measure of a material\u2019s resistance to strain-induced deformation. In contrast, this study proposes a unique theoretical measure based on the fractional release of elastic stress or strain energy through internal structural rearrangements under symmetry constraints. This new metric can be readily calculated using standard techniques of simulation and can rate the flexibility of a crystal on a scale of zero to one, zero signifying the least flexibility while one indicates maximum flexibility. Additionally, this development provides a unique and quantitative insight into the flexibility of crystals, a dimension that was previously unexplored. Using theoretical calculations, the team examined the flexibility of four different systems with varying elastic stiffness and chemistries. They discovered that flexibility arises from large structural rearrangements associated with soft and hard vibrations within a crystal that strongly couples to strain fields. The team's research thus goes beyond traditional approaches by providing an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying a crystal's flexibility. Unlike previous studies that primarily focused on elastic properties, this work establishes flexibility as an intrinsic property of crystals, independent of their specific shape or form. The newfound measure of flexibility is poised to revolutionize materials science, especially in the context of MOFs. Prof. Waghmare emphasizes, \u201cThis theoretical framework enables the screening of thousands of materials in databases, providing a cost-effective and efficient way to identify potential candidates for experimental testing. The design of ultraflexible crystals becomes more achievable, offering a practical solution to the challenges posed by traditional experimental methods.\u201d The collaborative effort underlying this research is particularly noteworthy, with a team of physicists and chemists from Oxford University and the University of California, Santa Barbara involved in the study. This interdisciplinary approach facilitated a more comprehensive understanding of the subject, bridging the gap between theoretical insights and experimental applications. While the proposed measure of flexibility is theoretical, experimentalists will find it very useful. The potential applications of this research extend beyond the realm of physics, opening doors to innovative materials with diverse applications in various industries. Paving the way for a new paradigm in materials research, the study exemplifies the significance of interdisciplinary collaboration and theoretical advancements in shaping the future of materials science.

{"title": "Indian scientists develop open-source tool to generate infrared star catalogue for Thirty Meter Telescope", "date_posted": "Posted On: 09 JUL 2024 6:06PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology Indian scientists develop open-source tool to generate infrared star catalogue for Thirty Meter Telescope Posted On: 09 JUL 2024 6:06PM by PIB Delhi A new online tool to create a comprehensive star catalogue for the Adaptive Optics (AO) system of the upcoming Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), can enable this ground-based telescope-- one of the largest to be operational in the next decade, generate sharper astronomical images. The Thirty Meter Telescope, the Giant Magellan Telescope, and the European Southern Observatory\u2019s Extremely Large Telescope represent the future of ground-based astronomy. India is a key partner in the TMT project, with India TMT Center at Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) leading the national collaboration. Telescopes on the surface of the Earth face the challenge of atmospheric distortion, affecting the quality of captured images. This is particularly crucial for telescopes with high light-collection capacities, like the TMT, which are sensitive to upper atmospheric disturbances. To counteract these distortions, the TMT will use an Adaptive Optics System (AOS) that continuously senses and adjusts for atmospheric changes to produce high-quality images. In order to do this, an all-sky catalogue of NIR stars is an essential requirement. \u201cThe AOS system on TMT, known as the Narrow Field Infrared Adaptive Optics System (NFIRAOS), will be enhanced by a Laser Guide Star (LGS) facility,\u201d explained Dr. Sarang Shah from IIA. \u201cThis facility will project up to nine lasers into the sky to create artificial guide stars. However, atmospheric turbulence affects these laser beams, so measuring atmospheric tip-tilt is uncertain. To correct these effects, the AO system requires feedback from three real stars, known as Natural Guide Stars (NGS).\u201d For optimal performance, simulations indicate that NFIRAOS requires at least three NGS within its field of view, each as bright as 22 magnitudes in the near-infrared J waveband. Currently, no such comprehensive catalogue of stars exists which will provide NGS in all-regions of the sky. For optimal performance, simulations indicate that NFIRAOS requires at least three NGS within its field of view, each as bright as 22 magnitudes in the near-infrared J waveband. To ensure these requirements are met across all regions of the sky, a comprehensive catalogue of NIR stars is essential. Currently, no such catalogue exists that can reliably provide NGS for all sky regions, highlighting the critical need for the new tool developed by Indian researchers to create this all-sky NIR star catalogue. Researchers at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) in Bengaluru and their collaborators have developed an automated code that can be used as an online tool to create a catalogue of Near Infrared (NIR) stars. \u201cThe automated code can compute the expected near-infrared magnitudes of stellar sources identified in various optical sky surveys using their optical magnitudes,\u201d noted Dr. Smitha Subramanian, co-author and faculty at IIA. Using multi-band optical photometry from the PAN-STARRS telescope, the researchers filtered and identified stars, predicting their near infrared magnitudes through innovative methods. They validated their approach using data from the UKIDSS survey of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, achieving over 85% accuracy in their NIR magnitude predictions. \u201cOur method shows great promise in generating the all-sky catalogue of NIR stars needed before TMT\u2019s first run in the next decade,\u201d added Dr. Sarang Shah the lead researcher. India\u2019s participation in the TMT collaboration involves three institutes: the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), Bengaluru, the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, and the Aryabhatta Research Institute for Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. This research was conducted at the India-TMT Coordination Center (ITCC), headquartered at IIA, Bengaluru, which is an autonomous institution under the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. The detailed findings of this research were published in the Astronomical Journal.

Deep time hyperthermal events are considered potential analogs for future climate predictions. However, data of these hyperthermal events are mainly known from the mid- and high latitude regions. However, there is lack of quantitative data from the equatorial or tropical regions. Researchers from Birbal Sahni institution of Palaeosciences (BSIP), an autonomous institute of Department of Science and Technology, used fossil pollen and carbon isotope data from the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM-2), also known as H-1 or Elmo, a period of global warming that occurred around 54 million years ago, to quantify the terrestrial hydrological cycle during that period. It was during this period that the Indian plate lingered near the equator during its journey from the southern to northern hemisphere.\u00a0 This makes the Indian plate a perfect natural laboratory that offers a peculiar opportunity to understand the vegetation-climate relationship near the equator during the ETM-2. On the basis of availability of fossils from ETM2, the researchers selected the Panandhro Lignite Mine of Kutch in Gujarat and collected fossil pollen from there. Analyzing the pollen, they found that when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was more than 1000 ppmv near the palaeo-equator, the rainfall decreased significantly, leading to the expansion of deciduous forests. The study published in the journal Geoscience Frontiers raises important questions about the survival of equatorial/ tropical rainforests and biodiversity hotspots under increased carbon emissions. It can help u nderstanding the relationship between CO 2 and hydrological cycle and aid in the future conservation of biodiversity hotspots. Fig. 1. The diagram shows the changing patterns of rainfall vis-\u00e0-vis vegetation under varying carbon dioxide concentration during the pre-hyperthermal, hyperthermal and post-hyperthermal events of the early Paleogene. **** PK/PSM (Release ID: 2030413) Visitor Counter : 1946 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image0014EBJ.jpg"]},

{"title": "Single-molecule techniques reveal new dynamics of protein folding associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression", "date_posted": "Posted On: 12 JUL 2024 6:09PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology Single-molecule techniques reveal new dynamics of protein folding associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression Posted On: 12 JUL 2024 6:09PM by PIB Delhi A new way to study protein folding & associated chaperons that saves proteins from non-native interaction, could help understand what exactly triggers the folding. The understanding could help track progression of diseases like cancer, Parkinsons and Alzheimer\u2019s. Proteins participate in almost every process within the cell. They need to adapt a well defined 3-D structure in order to carry out their assigned function called \u2018native conformation\u2019. But due to several chemical, environmental or physical stress conditions, the protein molecules may get misfolded or unfolded, leading to disfunction. It results in aggregation of toxic material in the cell, resulting in diseases. Neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or Parkinson\u2019s Disease have been linked to formation of toxic aggregates within a cell. While several newly translated proteins can fold spontaneously many of them require the assistance of molecular chaperones to achieve their native state and to avoid non-native interactions. Molecular chaperones are essential for keeping the protein molecules functioning properly. In addition to helping with folding, they can repair unfolding and misfolding too. In light of the importance of molecular chaperones in our well-being, researchers been studying their structure and functioning within the cell. Bulk biochemical measurements have informed us on the protein folding efficiency and prevention of aggregation when chaperones are present during protein folding. However, conventional bulk experiments cannot probe into the heterogeneity of the chaperone molecules and how each of these molecules function in diverse cells. Also, the short-lived transient states do not come under the scanner of bulk experiments. The significance of these transient states in the metabolic processes remains little understood. In recent years, development of single-molecule techniques has opened new avenues to explore the fundamental properties of biomolecules involved in diverse biochemical reactions. A team at the S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences (an autonomous institute of DST) under Prof. Shubhasis Halder, is using a Covalent Magnetic Tweezer (CMT) fabricated in their lab, to study physical and chemical properties of protein molecules and action of chaperones on how these molecules fold and function. This innovative approach has provided unprecedented insights into the intricate dynamics of chaperone-assisted protein folding. Among the key players in this molecular ballet are the heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp90, two of the most studied molecular chaperones. Single-molecule force spectroscopy has revealed the intricate dynamics of Hsp70-induced protein manipulation. The intricate details are crucial for understanding how Hsp70 assists in protein folding, stabilization, and transport under various cellular conditions. Hsp90 is also an important chaperone known to activate and stabilize many proteins, including steroid hormone receptors and signaling kinases. Single-molecule techniques were used to characterize the multiple pathways and states of the Hsp90 complex. This research, unveiled the multifaceted capabilities of magnetic tweezers in manipulating protein structures. Their findings have revealed novel mechanisms of molecular chaperones and provided insights into their functioning and implications for protein homeostasis and human diseases. A review of the series of studies was published in the journal Trends in Biochem Sciences. They highlight the mechanical dynamics underlying chaperone interactions with substrates under force, and that chaperones, particularly those localized within cellular tunnels, harness the force generated during protein translocation to facilitate substrate folding. These tunnel-associated chaperones utilize the mechanical energy derived from the tunnel to guide the folding process, thereby ensuring the proper maturation of proteins crucial for vital cellular functions. Furthermore, the investigation unveils the diverse mechanical functions exhibited by chaperones under force. The researchers are now beginning to understand the exact mechanism of how Alzheimer's sets in due to brain stiffness. When the physical basis of degenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s Disease are understood at a molecular level, drugs can be designed to target the mechanical roles of the chaperones. That will make it easier to prevent the progression of these diseases. \u201cHowever, a lot remains unanswered as we work at the junction of basic and translational research\u201d, says Debojyoti Chowdhury, the co-author of the review paper. Once existing gaps in understanding of dynamics of chaperones and their client proteins is understood, pharmaceutical science will be poised for the next leap forward.

{"title": "Scientists trace the effect of plasma composition on dynamics of astrophysical jets from celestial bodies", "date_posted": "Posted On: 08 JUL 2024 6:20PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology Scientists trace the effect of plasma composition on dynamics of astrophysical jets from celestial bodies Posted On: 08 JUL 2024 6:20PM by PIB Delhi Scientists have traced the effect of plasma composition of astrophysical jets which are outflows of ionized matter that are emitted as extended beams from celestial objects like black holes, neutron stars and pulsars. Despite years of research, it is not known with what kind of matter astrophysical jets are composed of-- whether they are made of bare electrons or protons or whether positively charged electrons called positrons are also present. Knowing the jet composition is vital as it will allow to pinpoint on the exact physical process at work near black holes and neutron stars. In general, in theoretical studies the relation between thermodynamic quantities of the jet like mass density, energy density and pressure do not have the information of composition. Such relation is called equation of state of the jet matter.\u00a0 Scientists from Aryabhatta Research Institute of observational sciences (ARIES), an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt. of India, used a relativistic equation of state which was partly proposed by them in an earlier paper on the role of composition of relativistic plasma in the actual evolution of jets. The research was led by Raj Kishor Joshi and Dr. Indranil Chattopadhyay from ARIES and has been published in the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ). The authors upgraded a numerical simulation code earlier developed by Dr. Chattopadhyay, used the said equation of state to study the dynamics of astrophysical jets composed of mixture of electrons, positrons (positively charged electrons), and protons. \u00a0 Figure: The density contours for jets with different plasma compositions (\u03be is the ratio of proton and electron number densities). The propagation direction of the jet is z (in kilo parsec or kpc) and the lateral expansion is in the radial (r) direction. The initial parameters (initial Lorentz factor \ud835\udf38 =10, the density of jet beam \u2374 =1.0, pressure p=0.02) for all the models (Model A1-A4) are kept the same. The jet is traveling into an ambient medium that is 1000 times denser than the jet. The forward shock (FS), the jet-head or contact discontinuity (CD) the reverse shock (RS) and one of the recollimation shock (RCS) surfaces are marked. \u03be=0 (Model A1) is the electron-positron pair jet, \u03be=1.0 (Model A4) is the electron-proton jet. Electron-positron jet is the slowest jet. The authors showed that the change in plasma composition leads to the difference in propagation velocities of the jets even if the initial parameters for the jets remain the same. Jets composed of electrons and positrons were found to be slowest in comparison to jets containing protons, contrary to expectation. Protons are about two thousand times more massive than electrons or positrons. It is essential to understand the plasma composition of jets as the change in plasma composition changes the internal energy of the jet which is reflected in the change in propagation speeds. In addition, the plasma composition also affects the jet structures like number and strength of recollimation shocks, shape and dynamics of reverse shock and so on. Recollimation shocks are the regions in the jet beam that form due to the interaction of the jet beam with the backflowing material. The electron-positron jets show more pronounced turbulent structures. The growth of these structures also results in the deceleration of the jets. The formation and growth of turbulent structures are known to affect the stability of the jets. Hence, plasma composition may also influence the long-term stability of the jets.

They've created a new, user-friendly way to generate truly unpredictable random numbers, which is crucial for stronger encryption in quantum communications. This advance could revolutionize how we protect sensitive data in the future. The security of quantum communications relies on inherent randomness as a seed, such as randomness in measurement bases chosen by sender and receiver. This prevents malicious agents from deciphering secure information through prior knowledge of such choice of bases. The Quantum Information and Computing (QuIC) lab at Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, an autonomous institute of Department of Science and Technology, had performed a photonic experiment to demonstrate violation of what are called the Leggett Garg Inequalities (LGI)-- -- a litmus test for \"quantumness\" in a system in a loophole free manner. Taking this further, over the last few years, the group has carried out extensive research in collaboration with researchers from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, IISER-Thiruvananthapuram and the Bose Institute, Kolkata to use such LGI violation in a completely unexplored domain-- truly unpredictable random number generation, secure against device tampering and imperfections. These numbers are crucial in applications like cryptographic key generation, secure password creation and digital signatures among others. \u201cWe have successfully generated random numbers using temporal correlations certified by the violation of the Leggett Garg Inequality (LGI). These are temporal analogues of the popularly known Bell inequalities-- a set of mathematical expressions that compare the predictions of quantum mechanics with those of classical physics. Our experimental setup ensures a loophole-free violation of LGI, providing an additional advantage of generating loophole-free randomness,\u201d said Professor Urbasi Sinha, faculty at RRI, PI of the QuIC lab where the work was carried out, and the corresponding author of the paper recently published in the Physical Review Letters . In today's digital world, where we rely heavily on technology, strong passwords are vital for everyone's safety. This new method offers the enhanced protection we all need in our daily lives, by using truly random numbers to generate keys that will be used to encrypt the passwords, the researchers noted. \u201cIt is resilient against attacks on the initial state, which is typically the most vulnerable point in this scheme. The certified random numbers are important because any predictability of these numbers can compromise the entire security system, making it vulnerable to attacks. These numbers ensure the robustness of encryption, authentication and data integrity processes and maintain trust and security in digital interactions,\u201d added Sinha. There are several advantages in generating certified random numbers using this method. \u201cThese include the creation of strongly protected passwords, enhanced account security by resisting brute-force attacks, ensuring uniqueness, integrity thereby preventing forgery and token generation with multi-factor authentication, adding a crucial security layer in this vulnerable cyber world\u201d said Dr. Debashis Saha, IISER Thiruvananthapuram faculty and co-author of the study. In the photonic experiment led by RRI, the team replaced this conventional two-particle system with a single-particle setup. \u201cThe existing two-particle scenario for measuring correlations had drawbacks, wherein, an entangled state of two particles would get created and transferred to two measurement stations. Noise generated during the process could, thus, interfere in the entanglement. Besides, the requirement of maintaining a distance of 200 meters between the two particles to ensure the loophole free design, makes the whole process highly complicated\u201d, said Pingal Pratyush Nath, a PhD student at IISc and the first author of the study, who is co-supervised by Professor Sinha. Additionally, the single-particle scheme used measurements that required temporal separation instead of spatial, thus providing a compact random number generator with a potential to get commercialized for varied applications. The experiment generated over 9,00,000 random bits at a rapid rate of nearly 4,000 bits/second. This high random number generation can help in using these numbers towards various applications that require rapid randomness. With further engineering interventions and innovations, devices adopting this method could find powerful applications not only in cybersecurity and data encryption, but also in the context of varied types of randomness-based simulations and randomized control trial statistical studies in diverse important areas. \u201cThese include economic surveys, drug designing/testing, as well as for any futuristic technology that would rely on provable unpredictability as a critical resource\u201d, said Bose Institute\u2019s Professor Dipankar Home, another co-author of the study.

{"title": "Yoga can bring relief for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients", "date_posted": "Posted On: 15 JUL 2024 4:45PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology Yoga can bring relief for Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients Posted On: 15 JUL 2024 4:45PM by PIB Delhi Yoga can significantly improve the health of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients, shows a new study from AIIMS, New Delhi. RA is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. It causes joint damage and pain and can affect other organ system as well like lung, heart and brain. Traditionally, yoga has been known for its physical and mental well-being benefits. A collaborative study \u00a0by Lab for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, Anatomy Dept, and Dept of Rheumatology AIIMS, ND, supported by DST, explored the effects of yoga at a cellular and molecular level in RA patients and how yoga may benefit RA patients beyond just pain relief. It has been discovered that yoga lowers inflammation by controlling cellular damage and oxidative stress (OS). It balances pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, raises endorphin levels, and reduces cortisol and CRP levels and maintains melatonin rhythms. This facilitates the disruption of the inflammatory and hyperactive immune system cycle. At a molecular level, by boosting the activity of the telomerase enzyme and genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation, it slows down the aging process of cells. Additionally, yoga improves mitochondrial function, which guards against telomere attrition and DNA damage by enhancing energy metabolism and lowering oxidative stress. A study by Dr Rima Dada and her team at the Lab for Molecular Reproduction and Genetics, Anatomy Dept, AIIMS, supported by DST, documented reduced pain perception, improved joint mobility, decreased disability, and enhanced overall quality of life for patients performing yoga. These benefits were attributed to yoga's ability to establish immunological tolerance and molecular remission. The study published in Scientific Reports, 2023 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42231-w shows that yoga may help manage stress, a known trigger for RA symptoms. By lowering stress hormones like cortisol, yoga may indirectly reduce inflammation, may improve mitochondrial function, which can impact energy production and cellular health and reduce severity of comorbid depression by increased levels of \ud835\udefd-endorphin, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), melatonin, and sirtuin-1 (SIRT-1).Yoga promotes neuroplasticity and thus aids in better coping strategies and reduces severity of comorbid depression. This research provides evidence for the potential of yoga as a complementary therapy for RA patients. Yoga may not only manage symptoms like pain and stiffness but could also contribute to disease control and improved quality of life. Unlike drugs, yoga has no side effects and offers a cost-effective, natural alternative for managing severe autoimmune conditions.

The indigenous platforms could lower costs of quantum optics labs and be used for medicine, remote sensing, geo-mapping and space. At the heart of any quantum optics laboratory lies its high precision laser systems. But their exorbitant costs have been detrimental in both pursuing cutting-edge research and quantum technology based industrial applications. RRI which developed the technology for precision laser systems required for quantum enabled-technology applications and industrial uses, recently awarded the license to nexAtom Research and Instruments, the first spin-off company from RRI. This spinoff company will soon commence production of the multi-channel, tunable laser system technology platforms. RRI has filed a provisional Indian patent for \u2018Standalone laser system with frequency tunability and precision control\u2019. Last year, India embarked on an ambitious Rs. 6,000 crore National Quantum Mission (NQM). RRI is contributing towards the creation of an ecosystem enabling the smooth implementation of quantum-based technology solutions for the future. The tunable lasers which are called the External Cavity Diode Lasers (ECDL), are very precise spectroscopic tools meant for addressing quantum systems in research and technology labs. Such tunable laser systems will be useful for developing solutions across quantum communication, quantum technology, quantum system and metrology \u2013 all of which are the core themes of the DST-led NQM. The work on nexAtom\u2019s tunable laser system commenced around 2017, when the control electronics technology for lasers was transitioning from the analogous to digital mode. \u201cBy tweaking the mechanical assembly for laser diodes and performing basic re-programming to extend features, our system can be suitably customized as per various end-user requirements. It offers a versatile range of applications in the fields of medicine, remote sensing, geo-mapping, space and marine navigation among others. Also, the need for buying auxiliary systems and instruments, which add to the overall costs, will not be required with the nexAtom laser systems,\u201d said Subodh Vashist, Founder and the System Design Expert of the spinoff company. The nexAtom\u2019s laser systems can be bought as an entire integrated package or a sub-system, this makes it highly cost-effective. Through this spinoff company\u2019s journey, RRI and nexAtom wish to create a template for others in academia working in the quantum domain towards entrepreneurship in India, remarked Professor Sadiq Rangwala, professor at the Light and Matter group at RRI. \u201cThis venture is a contribution towards setting up a high-end scientific ecosystem in the country. The development of a future-compliant prototype laser system is a critical pillar for supporting the upcoming NQM,\u201d said Prof. Rangwala, who is also the Principal Technical Advisor to the company. The strength of the company is in the work undertaken at the RRI\u2019s Quantum Interactions (QuaInt) lab, which over two decades, has earned rich experience in this domain. In addition, the lab envisions facilitating high-quality yet cost-effective solutions as opportunities to users beyond academia. \u201cOur lab\u2019s multi-disciplinary approach of working on the interactions between quantum systems has resulted in the development of multiple products. These products have augmented our lab\u2019s self-reliance and enhanced research in quantum physics,\u201d said Prof. Rangwala. In addition to the precision tunable laser system, some of the other products of nexAtom are: precision time taggers used for quantum applications to count single-photon events; ultra-fast seed fibre lasers for various pulsed laser applications; Q-switched fibre and diode lasers used commonly for metal 3D printing and more. As India gets ready to take a \u2018quantum\u2019 leap through NQM, there would be a requirement of an ecosystem to build a plethora of customized lasers and associated instruments, in order to meet various quantum technology-oriented goals. Finally, this would create a high demand for skilled employees to work on developing indigenous quantum technology-based solutions, said Subodh . \u201cIn order to build high quality and reliable laser systems, we need skilled engineers and PhDs , who can work within an interdisciplinary environment,\u201d said Prof. Rangwala.

In an era where renewable energy sources are gaining paramount importance, water splitting emerges as a beacon of hope in the quest for sustainable energy solutions. Water splitting can be reckoned as a sustainable and eco-friendly way to generate green and pure H 2 and O 2 on a larger scale without harming the flora and fauna. To explore ways of increasing the efficiency of water splitting, scientists from the Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST) under the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of India, in Guwahati, have assessed one of the two important reactions that come into play -- hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The work led by Dr. Biswajit Choudhury and the main author Mr. Suvankar Deka focused on the understanding of the oxygen evolution ability of Nickel-Iron Layered double hydroxides. This is because improving the efficiency of the OER contributes to the overall efficiency of water-splitting processes. In addition to NiFe Layered Double Hydroxide (LDH), they synthesized two other trimetallic systems ZnNiFe layered double hydroxide and CoNiFe LDH, and investigated its electrocatalytic activity in 1M KOH. Strikingly, the OER activity of the trimetallic systems was found to be slower than the bimetallic system. The research provided m echanistic Insights into electrocatalytically reduced OER performance in marigold-like trimetallic NiFe-based LDH. Their investigation accepted for publication in the Journal of Materials Chemistry A, revealed that the reduced activity in the trimetallic system can be attributed to breakage in the charge transfer chain of Ni-O-Fe-O-Zn and Ni-O-Fe-O-Co moieties (part of a molecule) as well as confinement of phonons (quantum of vibrational energy). This leads to the trapping of charge carriers affecting the reaction pathway and kinetics resulting in reduced water oxidation activity. The study suggests that doping of the bimetallic NiFe system does not improve its water splitting efficiency and can help in focussed research on finding ways of improving the bimetallic system for oxygen generation through overall splitting.\u00a0\u00a0 Publication link: https://doi.org/10.1039/D3TA07489G **** PK/PSM (Release ID: 2033659) Visitor Counter : 1214 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image001HOJT.jpg"]},

A team at Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST) Guwahati, an autonomous institute of Department of Science & Technology, has identified Ionic Liquids (ILs) which can be promising sustainable alternatives to the toxic chemicals currently in use for the silk protein extraction process. The team led by Dr. Kamatchi Sankaranarayan has identified 4 different ILs that can be effective in extracting silk proteins from raw fibres. This new research, published in Chemistry Select by Wiley Publishers, has potential for use in sericin extraction from both mulberry (Bombyx mori) and non-mulberry silks, such as Muga (Antheraea assamensis) and Eri (Philosamia ricini), indigenous to Northeast India. \u00a0 \u00a0 The researchers explored six different ILs and found some of them were particularly effective in removing sericin without damaging the silk protein structure. The ones showing greatest promise included 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride (BMIM.Cl), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIM.BF4), and Tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB). TEAB appeared to be highly effective due to its ability to destabilize sericin proteins. The research holds great significance for the silk industry. Not only does it offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical methods, but it also paves the way for efficient sericin extraction from non-mulberry silks, potentially leading to new applications for these unique fibers. This is the first instance of using ILs for sericin extraction from non-mulberry silks, highlighting the potential of this new approach for a more sustainable and diverse silk industry. **** PK/PSM (Release ID: 2032812) Visitor Counter : 1640 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP", "images": ["https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/userfiles/image/image0017M3H.png"]},

{"title": "New strain of lactic acid bacterium could be promising probiotic for food and pharmaceutical industry", "date_posted": "Posted On: 22 JUL 2024 1:24PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology New strain of lactic acid bacterium could be promising probiotic for food and pharmaceutical industry Posted On: 22 JUL 2024 1:24PM by PIB Delhi Scientists have uncovered a new strain of lactic acid bacterium that could be a promising candidate for broader probiotic utilization beyond the dairy industry. The researchers from Agharkar Research Institute (ARI) Pune, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology were keen to uncover the hidden potential of S. thermophilus often acclaimed for its role as a starter culture in various dairy products, through a collaborative genome analysis. A probe into the genetic makeup of strain MCC0200 revealed an arsenal of genes associated with gastrointestinal survival, intestinal adhesion, and health-promoting functionalities, painting a vivid picture of its probiotic prowess. One of the key challenges for any probiotic is surviving the treacherous journey through the human digestive system. In vitro studies revealed that MCC0200 not only withstands the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract but also exhibits remarkable resilience against gastric juices and bile acids, which are the known crucial factors in determining probiotic efficacy. Delving deeper into its genome, the study published in the journal Microorganisms uncovered a repertoire of genes that can help acid tolerance and bile resistance, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underpinning its survival strategy. They found that MCC0200 which thrives in the gut, possesses a strong affinity for intestinal surfaces, allowing it to interact with host cells. This ability to adhere to mucosal surfaces is a crucial factor in promoting gut health and immune function. They also unravelled MCC0200's ability to auto aggregate and co-aggregate with pathogenic bacteria, a trait essential for competitive exclusion and gut colonization. Studies revealed MCC0200's antioxidative prowess, a quality that holds significant implications for gut health. With its ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, MCC0200 emerged as a guardian of gut redox balance, offering protection against oxidative stress-induced damage. MCC0200 has also been revealed to be a nutrient powerhouse. Genome analysis uncovered the bacterium's biosynthetic capabilities, including the production of essential vitamins like folate (vitamin B9). Folate plays a crucial role in various cellular functions, and MCC0200's ability to synthesize this vital nutrient could have far-reaching implications for human health. This revelation underscores its potential as a nutritive supplement, offering valuable vitamins to individuals deficient in these vital nutrients. In the battle against cholesterol, MCC0200 emerges as a formidable ally. Studies demonstrated that this probiotic strain possesses the ability to assimilate cholesterol, potentially lowering serum cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. While the exact mechanism is still under investigation, MCC0200's cholesterol-lowering properties hold promise as a functional food ingredient with cardiovascular benefits. As research into the health benefits of probiotics continues to evolve, Streptococcus thermophilus stands out as a beacon of hope for gut health with diverse health-promoting attributes. Its unique combination of probiotic properties, coupled with its safety profile, makes it a promising candidate for food and pharmaceutical applications. With further exploration and innovation, MCC0200 could pave the way for a healthier future for all.

Deliberate non-affixation of FASTag on the windscreen leads to unnecessary delays at the toll plazas causing inconvenience to the fellow National Highway users. Detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) has been issued to all User Fee Collection Agencies and Concessionaires to charge double user fee in case of non-affixation of FASTag on the front windshield. The information will also be prominently displayed at all User Fee plazas, informing highway users about the penalties for non-compliance of entering a toll lane without a fixed FASTag on front windshield. In addition, CCTV footage with Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) at the fee plaza shall be recorded of the non-affixed FASTag cases. This will help in maintaining proper record regarding the fee charged and presence of the vehicle in the toll lane. In accordance with already established rules, NHAI aims to enforce the standard procedural guidelines for affixation of FASTag on the front windshield of the assigned vehicle from inside. Any FASTag that is not affixed on the assigned vehicle as per standard process is not entitled to carry out Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) transaction at a User Fee Plaza and will have to pay double toll fee as well as can be duly blacklisted. \u00a0Issuer banks have also been directed to ensure fixation of the FASTag to the assigned vehicle on front windshield at the time of issuance from various Point-of-Sale (POS). NHAI collects user fee on National Highways as per the National Highway Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008. At present, user fee is collected for approximately 45,000 km of National Highways and Expressways at around 1,000 Toll Plazas on National Highways across the country.\u00a0\u00a0 With penetration rate of around 98 percent and over 8 crore users, FASTag has revolutionized the Electronic Toll Collection system in the country. This initiative of charging double user fee from non-affixation of FASTag will help to make toll operations more efficient and ensure seamless & comfortable journey for the National Highway users. *********** MJPS (Release ID: 2034064) Visitor Counter : 5128 Read this release in: Gujarati , Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Marathi , Tamil , Telugu , Kannada", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

{"title": "International study observes smaller object in a black hole pair directly for the first time", "date_posted": "Posted On: 18 JUL 2024 6:40PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Science & Technology International study observes smaller object in a black hole pair directly for the first time Posted On: 18 JUL 2024 6:40PM by PIB Delhi A new study carried out by a group of 32 scientists from 10 countries (Finland, Poland, India, China, USA, Czech Republic, Japan, Germany, Spain, Italy) spotted the smaller black hole of a pair, establishing the \u2018sight\u2019 of an orbiting blackhole for the first time. Several international research groups have already confirmed the theory that there are two black holes at the centre of the four billion light years distant galaxy OJ 287, first suggested by astronomers at the University of Turku, Finland. In 2021, NASA's exoplanet-hunting satellite was pointed towards the galaxy OJ 287 to help astronomers confirm the theory initially proposed by researchers at the University of Turku, Finland, of two black holes at the centre of the galaxy. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is designed to discover thousands of exoplanets orbit around the brightest dwarf stars in the sky. TESS is finding planets ranging from small, rocky worlds to giant planets, showcasing the diversity of planets in our galaxy. It has so far found 410 confirmed exoplanets or \u201cnew worlds\u201d circling stars other than the Sun. In 2021, TESS spent several weeks studying another kind of system, a 4 billion light years away galaxy called OJ 287. Researchers have found indirect evidence that a very massive black hole in OJ 287 is orbiting a giant black hole 100 times its size. To verify the existence of the smaller black hole, TESS monitored the brightness of the primary black hole and the jet associated with it. Direct observation of the smaller black hole orbiting the larger one is very difficult, but its presence was revealed to the researchers by a sudden burst of brightness. This kind of an event had never been observed in OJ287 before, but researcher Pauli Pihajoki from the University of Turku in Finland predicted the event in his doctoral dissertation already in 2014. According to his dissertation, the next flare was expected to take place in late 2021, and several satellites and telescopes were focused on the object at the time. The TESS satellite detected the expected flare on 12 November 2021 and the observations of the 12 hour event were recently published the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The study of the observation by Shubham Kishore, Alok C. Gupta, both from Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences, an autonomous institute under the Dept. of Science & Technology, Govt. of India and Paul Wiita, The College of New Jersey, USA discovered a smaller black hole. The discovery was also confirmed by NASA's Swift telescope, which was also pointed at the same target. In addition, a large international collaboration led by Staszek Zola from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland, detected the same event by using telescopes in different parts of the Earth. The different telescopes were targeted for the observation so that it was always nighttime at least at one of the telescope locations throughout the entire day. Moreover, a group from Boston University, USA, led by Svetlana Jorstad and other observers confirmed the discovery by studying the polarisation of light before and after the flare. In a new study combining all the previous observations, Professor Mauri Valtonen and his research team at the University of Turku have shown that the 12-hour burst of light came from the smaller black hole in orbit and its surroundings. The fast burst of brightness occurs when the smaller black hole \"swallows\" a large slice of the accretion disk surrounding the larger black hole, turning it into an outward jet of gas. The jet of the smaller black hole is then brighter than that of the larger black hole for about twelve hours.\u00a0 This makes the colour of OJ287 less reddish, or \"yellow\", instead of the normal red. After the burst, the red colour returns. The \"yellow\" colour indicates that for the 12-hour period, we are seeing the light from the smaller black hole. The same results can be inferred from other features of the light emitted from OJ287 over the same time period. \u201cTherefore, we can now say that we have \u2018seen\u2019 an orbiting black in the same way that we can say that TESS has seen planets orbiting other stars. And just as with planets, it is extremely difficult to get a direct image of the smaller black hole. In fact, because of OJ 287's great distance, which is close to four billion light years, it will probably take a very long time before our observation methods have developed enough to catch a picture even of the larger black hole,\u201d say Professor Valtonen. \u201cHowever, the smaller black hole may soon reveal its existence in other ways, as it is expected to emit nano-Hertz gravitational waves. The gravitational waves of OJ 287 should be detectable in the coming years by the maturing pulsar timing arrays,\u201d says A. Gopakumar from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India. Image 1. The observed burst appears as a sharp flaring of the light curve from satellite observations, showing how an otherwise consistently dim object brightens suddenly and sharply. In the upper corner, the observed flaring is shown in more detail. The amount of light emitted in the burst is equivalent to the brightness of about 100 galaxies. (Image Kishore, Gupta, Wiita 2024) Image 2. The black holes in orbit around each other. Both black holes have jets associated with them: the larger one with reddish colour, and the smaller one with a yellowish colour jet. Normally only the reddish jet is seen, but during the 12 hour period on November 12, 2021, the smaller jet dominated, and gave a direct signal from the smaller black hole, and was observed for the first time.

Prices of LPG in the country are linked to its price in the international market. Government continues to modulate the effective price to consumer for domestic LPG. During the period 2020-21 to 2022-23, the average Saudi CP (international benchmark for LPG pricing) went up from $415 per MT to $712 per MT. However, the increase in the international prices was not fully passed on to the customers. Government has reduced the effective price of domestic LPG by Rs. 200 per 14.2 Kg LPG cylinder with effect from 30 th August, 2023. Under PAHAL Scheme, the domestic LPG cylinders are sold at non-subsidised price and the applicable subsidy to the consumers is transferred directly into their bank accounts. Apart from the direct subsidy to bank accounts to consumers, the OMCs have also been compensated Rs 22,000 crore in FY 2022-23 by Government of India to cover the under-recoveries suffered by them in not passing on the high international prices to the domestic LPG consumers. W.e.f. 21 st May, 2022, Government has been providing a budgetary support for targeted subsidy of Rs. 200 per 14.2 Kg LPG cylinder for Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries for upto 12 refills a year for years 2022-23 and 2023-24. Moreover, w.e.f. 5 th October, 2023, the targeted subsidy increased to Rs. 300 per 14.2 Kg LPG cylinder for all Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) beneficiaries. The current RSP of domestic LPG at Delhi is Rs. 803 per 14.2 Kg cylinder. With a targeted subsidy of Rs. 300 per cylinder (and proportionately prorated for 5 Kg cylinder), effective cost for PMUY consumers is Rs. 503 per 14.2 Kg cylinder (at Delhi) currently. Prices of cooking gas in India, after the latest round of reduction, are one of the lowest globally, and even lower than in most LPG producing nations. The effective price of domestic LPG cylinder in neighbouring countries as on 01.05.2024 is as below: \t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Country \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Domestic LPG (Rs./14.2 kg. cyl.)# \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t India \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t 503.00* \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Pakistan \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t 1017.25 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Sri Lanka \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t 1320.94 \t\t\t \t\t \t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t Nepal \t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t\t 1207.84 \t\t\t \t\t \t #Source: Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell *Effective cost to PMUY beneficiaries in Delhi Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was started in May, 2016 with the objective of providing access to clean cooking fuel to poor households in the country according to a defined criteria. Under PMUY, deposit free LPG connections are provided to adult women from poor households. LPG consumption of PMUY beneficiaries is monitored on regular basis. Consumption of domestic LPG by households depends on several factors like food habits, household size, cooking habits, price, availability of alternate fuels etc. More than 105 crore refills have been taken by PMUY beneficiaries in the last 3 years alone. Per capita consumption of PMUY beneficiaries (in terms of no. of 14.2 kg LPG cylinders taken per year) has increased from 3.01 (FY 2019-20) to 3.95 (FY 2023-24). Further, the Government has taken several steps to encourage consumption of LPG, which include targeted subsidy of \u20b9300/- per 14.2 Kg refill upto 12 refills/year for PMUY beneficiaries, option of 5 Kg Double Bottle Connection (DBC), swap option from 14.2 kg to 5 Kg, upto 3 free refills to PMUY beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Package from April 2020 to December 2020 etc. This information was given by the MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SHRI SURESH GOPI, in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. **** M onika (Release ID: 2035035) Visitor Counter : 211 Read this release in: Gujarati", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

The Minister was speaking at the inaugural session of first edition of Urja Varta. Addressing the distinguished gathering, he underscored the importance of the exploration and production (E&P) sector in achieving energy self-sufficiency and sustaining economic growth. He highlighted the vast potential of India\u2019s 26 sedimentary basins, containing substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas yet to be fully tapped. Despite our substantial progress, the Minister said, \u201cOnly 10% of our sedimentary basin area is under exploration today. After the award of blocks under the forthcoming Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) Rounds, it will increase to 16% by end-2024.\u201d Highlighting the need to streamlining operational and regulatory processes, Shri Puri stressed that \u201cThe government is doing its part to catalyse investments in E&P. The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG) has instituted sweeping reforms, empowering stakeholders to contribute to our nation's progress\u201d, he added. He said that we intend to increase India's exploration acreage to 1 million sq. km. by 2030. \u201cNo- Go\u201d areas in India\u2019s EEZ have been reduced by almost 99%\u201d, Shri Puri added further. Minister talked about accelerated pace of exploration activities through initiatives like the OALP and the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Policy. \u201cThrough the first 8 OALP bid rounds, a total of 144 blocks covering approximately 244,007 sq. km. have been awarded and recently announced OALP IX round offers an area of approximately 136,596 sq. km. spread over 8 sedimentary basins, with the vision of expanding nation's footprint in offshore exploration\u201d, he noted. He said, the Discovered Small Field (DSF) Policy, since its inception in 2015, has garnered investments of approximately 2 billion USD and brought in 29 new players in the field. Highlighting the focus of Government on promoting scientific data-driven exploration, Shri Puri said that an investment of Rs. 7,500 crores is going into the acquisition of new seismic data, including that of the EEZ, financing stratigraphic wells, and acquiring aerial survey data for difficult terrains. \u201cWe now have geo-scientific data for the Kerala\u2013Konkan basin and the Mumbai offshore basin on the West coast, and the Mahanadi and the Andaman basins on the East coast\u201d, he said. He also referred to the upgradation of the National Data repository to a cloud-based NDR by DGH. It will enable instant dissemination of seismic, well and production data, he said. Talking about the efforts of Government to ensure Ease of Doing Business in E&P sector, he noted, \"We have consolidated and simplified 37 approval processes into 18, with 9 processes now eligible for self-certification. However, we recognize the need to push these reforms further.\"\"We must explore the feasibility of expanding self-certification across additional processes,\" Minister continued. He said, \"Reducing delays in the approval of field development plans, annual plans, and other regulatory permissions is crucial, especially as our nation's import dependency continues to rise.\" The Minister announced the formation of a Joint Working Group (JWG) comprising representatives from private E&P operators, the National Oil Companies, MoPNG, and DGH to address industry concerns and improve the ease of doing business in the sector.

{"title": "COVERAGE OF UJJWALA YOJANA", "date_posted": "Posted On: 22 JUL 2024 4:01PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas COVERAGE OF UJJWALA YOJANA Posted On: 22 JUL 2024 4:01PM by PIB Delhi Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) was launched on 01.05.2016 to release deposit free LPG connection in the name of adult woman member of poor households across the country. The primary objective of the PMUY is to provide access to clean cooking fuel LPG to such poor households thereby protecting their health by reducing the serious health hazards associated with use of conventional cooking fuel such as firewood, coal, cow dung etc. which cause severe indoor household air pollution. Use of LPG as cooking fuel frees women from the drudgery of collecting firewood, reduces time spent on cooking and prevents deforestation. As on 31.01.2024, 10.15 Crore PMUY connections have been released across the country. In order to augment LPG coverage in the country various steps have been taken inter alia, including organizing campaigns for promotion of PMUY, organizing melas/camps to enroll and distribute connections, promotion through Out of Home (OOH) hoardings, radio jingles, Information, Education and Communication (IEC) Vans etc., spreading awareness about advantages of using LPG over other conventional fuels and safe usage of LPG through LPG Panchayats, enrolment/awareness camps under Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, facilitation of consumers and their families for Aadhar enrolment and opening of bank accounts for getting PMUY connections , simplification of process of getting LPG connection, online application for PMUY connection at www.pmuy.gov.in, nearest LPG distributors, Common Service Centres (CSC) etc., option of 5 Kg Double Bottle Connection (DBC), swap option from 14.2 Kg to 5 Kg, provision for Migrant Families to avail new connection on Self-Declaration instead of Proof of Address\u00a0 and Ration Card. Further, OMCs are continuously commissioning new LPG Distributorships, especially in rural areas. Since the launch of PMUY scheme, OMCs have commissioned 7905 Distributorships across the country, out of which 7325 (i.e. 93 %) are catering to rural areas (commissioned during 01.04.2016 to 30.06.2024). As a result of these efforts, the per capita consumption for PMUY beneficiaries has improved to 3.95 refills per year. Further, LPG coverage in the country has improved from 62% in April 2016 to near saturation now. Independent studies and reports have shown that PMUY scheme has had a significant positive impact on the lives of rural households, especially women and families in rural and remote areas. Some key benefits are briefly explained below: (i) PMUY had resulted in a shift from traditional cooking methods that involve burning solid fuels like wood, dung and crop residues. The use of cleaner fuel lowers indoor air pollution, leading to improved respiratory health, particularly among women and children who are traditionally more exposed to household smoke. (ii) Households in rural areas, especially those in remote locations, often spend a significant portion of their time and energy in collecting traditional cooking fuels. LPG has reduced drudgery and the time spent on cooking by women of poor households. The free time, thus, available with them can be utilized in multiple spheres for enhanced economic productivity. (iii) Transition from biomass and traditional fuels to LPG reduces the dependency on wood and other biomass for cooking purposes, leading to a decrease in deforestation and environmental degradation. This benefits not only the households but also contributes to broader environmental conservation efforts. (iv) The use of LPG for cooking reduces the risk of accidents related to open fires, which is particularly important for the safety of women and children. Accidental burns and injuries associated with traditional cooking methods are minimized, contributing to a safer household environment. (v) With improved cooking facilities, there is a potential positive impact on nutrition. Families may find it easier to cook a variety of nutritious meals, contributing to better overall health.

Releasing the provisional figures for the financial year 2023-24 here today, KVIC Chairman Shri Manoj Kumar said that surpassing all previous figures, there has been an increase of 399.69 per cent (approximately 400%) in sales, 314.79 per cent (approximately 315%) in production, and 80.96 per cent (approximately 81%) in new employment generation compared to the financial year 2013-14. In the financial year 2022-23, there was an increase of 332.14% in sales, 267.52% in production, and 69.75% in new employment generation compared to 2013-14. \u00a0 Shri Kumar said, this remarkable performance of KVIC has made a significant contribution towards realizing the vision of a 'Developed India' by 2047 and making India the third-largest economy in the world. He said, for the first time in the history of independent India, the sales of KVIC products have crossed Rs. 1.55 lakh crore in the financial year 2023-24. The sales figure in the financial year 2022-23 was Rs. 1.34 lakh crore. In the last ten financial years of the 'Modi Government,' the sales of indigenous Khadi and village industry products made by artisans in rural areas, which were Rs. 31154.20 crore in the financial year 2013-14, have increased to the highest level of Rs. 155673.12 crore in the financial year 2023-24, which is the greatest achievement so far. In the financial year 2023-24, KVIC's efforts have created 10.17 lakh new jobs in rural areas, strengthening rural India's economy. KVIC Chairman has attributed this historic achievement to the inspiration of revered Bapu, the guarantee of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, and the tireless efforts of crores of artisans working in remote villages of the country. He said that Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi's endorsement of Khadi\u00a0 has increased people's confidence in Khadi products. Khadi has become a 'new status symbol' of fashion for the youth. The demand for Khadi and village industry products is increasing rapidly in the market, which is reflected in the production, sales, and employment figures. He further said that in the last ten years, major changes and decisions have been taken under the guidance of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to increase the production of Khadi and village industries, which are yielding positive results. He further said that these figures are proof that the trust of the people of the country has increased in 'Make in India,' 'Vocal for Local,' and 'Swadeshi products.' The production of Khadi and village industry products, which was Rs. 26,109.08 crores in the financial year 2013-14, reached Rs. 108,297.68 crores in the financial year 2023-24, a jump of 314.79 per cent, while the production in the financial year 2022-23 was Rs. 95956.67 crores. This continuously increasing production is strong evidence that the Khadi and Village Industries Commission has done historical work in rural areas. In the last 10 financial years, Khadi and village industry products have set new sales records every year. While sales were Rs. 31,154.20 crores in the financial year 2013-14, they reached Rs. 1,55,673.12 crore in the financial year 2023-24, with an unprecedented increase of 399.69 per cent, the highest sales ever. There has also been an unprecedented increase in the production of Khadi fabrics in the last ten years. While the production of Khadi fabrics was Rs. 811.08 crores in the financial year 2013-14, it reached Rs. 3,206 crores in the financial year 2023-24 with a jump of 295.28 per cent, which is the best performance so far. The production of Khadi fabrics in the financial year 2022-23 was Rs. 2915.83 crore. The demand for Khadi fabrics has also increased rapidly in the last ten financial years. While its sales were only Rs. 1,081.04 crores in the financial year 2013-14, it reached Rs. 6,496 crores in the financial year 2023-24 with an increase of 500.90 per cent. Khadi fabrics worth Rs. 5,942.93 crore were sold in the financial year 2022-23. The promotion of Khadi by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi from big platforms has had a widespread impact on the sales of Khadi fabrics. The way the Prime Minister promoted Khadi during the G-20 summit held in the country last year has attracted the world community towards Khadi. The main objective of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission is to provide maximum employment opportunities in rural areas. KVIC has also set a record in this area in the last ten years. While the cumulative employment was 1.30 crore in the financial year 2013-14, it reached 1.87 crores in 2023-24, with an increase of 43.65 per cent. Similarly, while 5.62 lakh new jobs were created in the financial year 2013-14, it reached 10.17 lakh in the financial year 2023-24, with an increase of 80.96 per cent. 4.98 lakh rural Khadi artisans (spinners and weavers) and workers are also employed in manufacturing Khadi fabrics. The business of Khadi and Gramodyog Bhavan, New Delhi, has also seen unprecedented growth in the last ten years. While the business here was Rs. 51.13 crores in the financial year 2013-14, it increased by 87.23 per cent to Rs. 95.74 crores in the financial year 2023-24.

Besides the role, the Commission is also to undertake confidence building measures in light of the new and emerging challenges. In view the above, and, to protect and safeguard the interest of all Minorities, the NCM advised the State Governments/UTs to hold \u201cSARV DHARMA MEETING\u201d with all Communities at Sub-divisional level of the States, at least once in a month and, also at District level, half yearly, to curb incidents of attacks/ hate crimes on minority communities. The Commission stressed that this results in bitterness and communal disharmony amongst communities as hate is caused by mental weakness and anger. Further, every citizen have the right to follow and preach their own religion. Moreover it should be the responsibility of citizens and society to disown and condemn the hate crimes done by anti-social and disgruntled elements beside the punitive action taken by Government as per law of land. Authorities must evolve mechanisms, duly involving participation of civic society, to deter such anti-social, anti-national forces and to prevent occurrence of violence in the society.

The ship was struck by an anti-ship ballistic missile while carrying highly hazardous cargo. Their effective use of equipment and personnel to extinguish the fire and seal a significant hull breach prevented loss of life and a serious marine pollution incident. On January 26, 2024, the Marlin Luanda, carrying 84,147 tons of naphtha, was struck by an anti-ship missile en route from Suez to Incheon. The explosion ignited a cargo tank, creating a severe fire hazard. Captain Avhilash Rawat organized firefighting efforts, ensuring crew safety and maintaining the ship\u2019s navigability. Despite significant damage, the crew fought the fire with foam monitors and seawater. After four and a half hours, assistance arrived from the merchant tanker Achilles, French frigate FS Alsace, U.S. frigate USS Carney, and Indian warship INS Visakhapatnam. Despite the fire reigniting, trained Indian Navy firefighters, along with the Marlin Luanda crew, extinguished the fire and sealed a hull breach. Twenty-four hours after the strike, the Marlin Luanda sailed to safety under naval escort. Union Minister of Ports, Shipping, and Waterways, Shri Sarbananda Sonowal, expressed pride and appreciation for the honored seafarers and Indian Navy, stating, \"This recognition by the IMO highlights the extraordinary bravery and professionalism of Indian seafarers. Their actions have not only saved lives and prevented environmental disasters but have also brought immense pride to our nation. We salute their dedication and heroism.\" It is to be noted, the IMO invites nominations annually from member countries to honor seafarers for exceptional bravery at sea. This year, nominations were received until April 15, 2024, and were first scrutinized by an Assessment Panel of experts. The panel's recommendations were then reviewed by a Panel of Judges chaired by the Chairperson of the IMO Council. The final recommendations were reported to the Council of IMO, leading to the prestigious recognitions bestowed on the Indian seafarers. The annual awards ceremony will be held at IMO Headquarters in London on 2 December 2024 during the 109th session of the Maritime Security Committee. \u00a0 ***** MJPS/AK (Release ID: 2032551) Visitor Counter : 1126 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

However, it is associated with significant transaction costs. To help micro and small enterprises market their products through ecommerce platform, and reach wider markets, the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises launched a sub-scheme under RAMP namely \u201cMSME Trade Enablement and Marketing Initiative\u201d (MSME-TEAM Initiative) on 27 th June, 2024. This initiativeaims at assisting five lakh MSMEs to on board the Open Network Digital Commerce (ONDC) platform, through awareness workshops which will include hand-holding assistance for on boarding onto ONDC. This helps MSMEs in significantly reducing their transaction costs. MSME TEAM initiative aims to provide financial assistance to micro and small enterprises (MSEs) through Seller Network Participants, for catalogue preparation, account management, logistics and packaging material and design. The MSME TEAM initiative would enable MSMEs to present their products to a wider audience, thus unlocking new market prospects beyond their conventional customer base. As the MSMEs will have access to a greater number of suppliers and service providers, this Initiative would help in bringing down their cost of doing business. The commission for online commerce on ONDC would be lower than what is charged by traditional e-Commerce platforms. This will allow even the smallest of the micro/small enterprises to conduct online transactions. MSME TEAM initiative aims to benefit five lakh MSEs, of which half would be women \u2013owned MSEs. This information was given by Minister of State for Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, Sushri Shobha Karandlaje in a written reply in Rajya Sabha today. ***** MG/SK (Release ID: 2035097) Visitor Counter : 216 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour & Employment, Government of India participated in an industry interaction organised by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Employers\u2019 Federation of India (EFI) on 5 th July 2024 at Hyderabad. In her inaugural address, Smt. Sumita Dawra, Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, highlighted India\u2019s fast growth rates, and emphasized that India's demographic dividend and labour reforms are pivotal to driving future growth, alongside other growth engines of manufacturing, expansion of service sector, infrastructure, etc. Citing the RBI\u2019s KLEMS data, she conveyed that about 8 crore new employment opportunities were created in India during past five years [ending 2021-22], largely driven by various government initiatives aimed at incentivising and promoting manufacturing ( such as PLI, Make in India), expansion of services sector, access to micro credit, investments, emergence of new areas such as Gig and Platform workers, Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and Startups, etc. She further highlighted the growing gig economy, which is estimated to employ about 2.3 crore people by 2030. Smt. Dawra discussed the consolidation of 29 labour laws into four comprehensive codes aimed at simplifying regulations and administrative processes, including the decriminalization of labour laws, thereby enhancing ease of doing business and reduction in compliance burden. This will in turn be attractive for enhanced domestic and foreign investment flows, and in bringing supply chains and global value chains to India, she added. She further said that the reforms will stimulate the economy, enhancing employment opportunities, increasing female workforce participation, and improvements in social security and labour welfare, all of which are expected to drive inclusive growth in India. Currently, India's GDP is more than USD 3 trillion and is expected to reach USD 33 trillion by 2047 riding on various initiatives, including labour reforms, she added. Smt Dawra underscored the importance of expanding social security coverage for the unorganized and informal sectors while recognizing the need for governance reforms in the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). She also highlighted various systemic reforms initiated in ESIC and EPFO such as auto settlement of claims, reduction in rejections, and improving the pace of claims settlement in EPFO, as well as enhancing the coverage and quality of services in ESIC. During the interaction, presentations on various systemic reforms in ESIC and EPFO were made, outlining topics such as digitization, e-governance, and compliance simplification, with discussions aimed at gathering suggestions from participants to further improve these systems. The National Career Service (NCS) portal of Ministry of Labour and Employment was also showcased as a comprehensive solution for career counselling and employment networking. It was highlighted that more than 1 crore vacancies were mobilised on NCS portal during 2023-24. The portal is also integrating SIDH database from the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to ensure availability of rich pool of skilled jobseekers on the portal to reduce skill gap in labour market. The ongoing integration of databases of the two Ministries will effectively link the youth to both skills and employment, resulting in aligning the demand-supply gap in the labour market, it was informed. The session highlighted the collaborative efforts between the government and industry to create a positive environment for economic development and employment growth. Such interactions are crucial for creating awareness and implementing effective reforms, besides getting feedback from industry and other stakeholders. The session witnessed participation from over 300 industry representatives keen to engage in discussions on critical labour and employment reforms shaping India\u2019s economic landscape. Senior officials from the Ministry of Labour and Employment, EPFO, ESIC and State Government of Telangana also attended the session.

{"title": "EPFO Records Highest Addition of 19.50 lakh Net Members during Month of May 2024", "date_posted": "Posted On: 20 JUL 2024 5:32PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Labour & Employment EPFO Records Highest Addition of 19.50 lakh Net Members during Month of May 2024 9.85 lakh new members enrolled with EPFO during May 2024 Over 58 per cent of Total New Members Added in May 2024 belong to 18-25 Age Group Posted On: 20 JUL 2024 5:32PM by PIB Delhi Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO) has added 19.50 lakh net members in the month of May 2024. The addition during the month is the highest since the first payroll data was issued in April 2018. Further, the year-over-year analysis shows a growth of 19.62% in net member additions compared to May 2023. This surge in membership can be attributed to numerous factors, including increased employment opportunities, a growing awareness of employee benefits, and the effectiveness of EPFO's outreach programs. The data indicates that around 9.85 lakh new members have enrolled during May 2024. There is an increase of 10.96% in the new members from the previous month of April 2024 and 11.5% increase from the previous year May 2023. A noticeable aspect of the data is the dominance of the 18-25 age group, constituting a significant 58.37% of the total new members added in May 2024. This is in consonance with the earlier trend which indicates that most individuals joining the organized workforce are youth, primarily first-time job seekers. In addition, the net payroll data for the age group 18-25 for May 2024 is the highest since the first payroll data was published. The payroll data highlights that approximately 14.09 lakh members exited and subsequently re-joined EPFO. This figure depicts year-over-year growth of 23.47% compared to May 2023. These members switched their jobs and re-joined the establishments covered under the ambit of EPFO and opted to transfer their accumulations instead of applying for final settlement thus, safeguarding long-term financial well-being and extending their social security protection. Gender-wise analysis of payroll data unveils that out of the new members added during the month, around 2.48 lakh are new female members. This figure exhibits year over year growth of 12.15% compared to May 2023. Also, the net female member addition during the month stood at around 3.69 lakh reflecting year over year growth of 17.24% compared to May 2023. The surge in female member additions is indicative of a broader shift towards a more inclusive and diverse workforce. State-wise analysis of payroll data denotes that net member addition is highest in the five states/ UTs of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Haryana . These states constitute around 58.24 % of net member addition, adding a total of 11 .36 lakh net members during the month. Of all the states, Maharashtra is leading by adding 18.87 % of net members during the month. Month-on-month comparison of industry-wise data displays significant growth in the members working in establishments engaged in the industries viz. Expert services, Building and construction industry, Garments making, Textiles, Elec, mech or gen engg products, Engineers - engg. Contractors, Trading - commercial establishments, Beedi making, Electronic media companies in private sector etc. Of the total net membership, around 42.33% addition is from expert services (consisting of manpower suppliers, normal contractors, security services, miscellaneous activities etc.). The above payroll data is provisional since the data generation is a continuous exercise, as updating employee record is a continuous process. The previous data gets updated every month. From the month of April-2018, EPFO has been releasing payroll data covering the period September 2017 onwards. In monthly payroll data, the count of members joining EPFO for the first time through Aadhaar validated Universal Account Number (UAN), existing members exiting from coverage of EPFO and those who exited but re-joined as members, is taken to arrive at net monthly payroll. **** Himanshu Pathak (Release ID: 2034638) Visitor Counter : 1227 Read this release in: Tamil , Telugu , Urdu , Hindi , Marathi , Assamese", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

These, inter alia, include the following: \t TReDS: In order to solve the problem of delayed payment to MSMEs, RBI has issued guidelines for setting up and operating the TReDS. The scheme facilitates the financing of trade receivables of MSMEs from corporate and other buyers, including government departments and public sector undertakings (PSUs) through multiple financiers electronically. Three entities viz. Receivables Exchange of India Limited (RXIL), Mynd Solutions Private Limited and A-TReDS have started operating TReDS. So far, more than eighty thousand MSMEs have on-boarded and invoice discounting worth more than three lakh crores rupees have been achieved through the platform, cumulatively. \t TEAM Scheme: As a sub-scheme under the Central Scheme \u201cRaising and Accelerating MSME Performance\u201d, the Ministry of MSME launched a sub-scheme \u201cMSME Trade Enablement and Marketing Initiative\u201d (MSME-TEAM Initiative), which aims at assisting five lakh Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) for leveraging the Open Network Digital Commerce (ONDC) platform, through awareness workshops, hand-holding assistance and subsidies for\u00a0 catalogue preparation, account management, logistics and packaging material and design. iii. Finance, Income and Trade Rank (FIT Rank) Under the mentorship of SIDBI, CIBIL, in collaboration with Online PSB Loans Limited (OPL), launched FIT rank by leveraging the power of Goods and Services Tax (GST), Bank Statements, and Income Tax returns (ITR) information to provide a ranking model for MSME lending. The ranking model uses machine learning algorithms to arrive at the probability of an MSME becoming a non- performing asset (NPA) in the next 12 months based on its financial, income, and trade data. The ranking is done on a scale of 1 to 10 with FIT Rank 1 for the least risky MSME and FIT Rank 10 for the most at-risk MSME.

{"title": "Rebuttal to Citigroup's Research Report on Employment in India", "date_posted": "Posted On: 08 JUL 2024 2:51PM by PIB Delhi", "content": "Ministry of Labour & Employment Rebuttal to Citigroup's Research Report on Employment in India Citigroup report fails to consider the positive trends and comprehensive data from official sources RBI\u2019s KLEMS data indicates more than 8 crore (80 million) employment opportunities created from 2017-18 to 2021-22 translating to an average of over 2 crore (20 million) employment per year More than 6.2 Crore Net Subscribers Joined EPFO between September, 2017 - March, 2024 Substantial Increase in New Subscribers joining NPS Government Committed to Creating a Robust and Inclusive Job Market Posted On: 08 JUL 2024 2:51PM by PIB Delhi The recent research report by Citigroup on Employment in India quoted by some of the print and electronic media, which forecasts that India will struggle to create sufficient employment opportunities even with a 7% growth rate, fails to account for the comprehensive and positive employment data available from official sources such as the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and the Reserve Bank of India's KLEMS data . Therefore, the Ministry of Labour and Employment strongly rebuts such reports which do not analyse all official data sources available in the public domain. Employment Data for India According to PLFS and RBI's KLEMS data, India has generated more than 8 crore (80 million) employment opportunities from 2017-18 to 2021-22. This translates to an average of over 2 crore (20 million) employment per year, despite of the fact that the world economy was hit by COVID-19 pandemic during 2020-21 which contradicts Citigroup\u2019s assertion of India\u2019s inability to generate sufficient employment. This significant employment creation demonstrates the effectiveness of various government initiatives aimed at boosting employment across sectors. PLFS data The Annual PLFS report depicts an improving trend in labour market indicators related to: (i) Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), (ii) Worker Population Ratio (WPR) and (iii) Unemployment Rate (UR) for persons of age 15 years and above during 2017-18 to 2022-23. For instance, the WPR i.e. employment has increased from 46.8% in 2017-18 to 56% in 2022-23. Similarly, the labour force participation has also increased in the country from 49.8% in 2017-18 to 57.9% in 2022-23. The Unemployment Rate has declined from 6.0 % in 2017-18 to a low of 3.2% in 2022-23. The PLFS data shows that during the last 5 years, more employment opportunities have been generated compared to the number of people joining the labour force, resulting in a consistent reduction in the unemployment rate. This is a clear indicator of the positive impact of government policies on employment. Contrary to the report, which suggests a dire employment scenario, the official data reveals a more optimistic picture of the Indian job market. EPFO Data The formal sector employment figures are also being bolstered by government efforts to improve ease of doing business, enhance skill development, and provide incentives for job creation in both the public and private sectors. The EPFO data suggests that more and more workers are joining formal jobs. During 2023-24, more than 1.3 crore subscribers joined EPFO which is more than double compared to 61.12 lakh joined EPFO during 2018-19. Moreover, during last six and half years (since September, 2017 to March, 2024) more than 6.2 crore net subscribers have joined EPFO. New subscribers to NPS The data from National Pension System (NPS) indicates that more than 7.75 lakh new subscribers have joined the NPS during 2023-24 under the Central and State governments which is 30% more than 5.94 lakh new subscribers joining NPS under government sector during 2022-23. This substantial increase in new subscribers highlights the government's proactive measures to fill-up the vacancies in public sector in timely manner. Flexi-staffing sector In a recent interaction of Indian Staffing Federation (ISF) members with Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, ISF members informed that they are employing about 5.4 million formal contract workers. Nearly 30% demand in the sector remains unfulfilled at frontline across manufacturing, retail, banking due to talent shortages and labour mobility.\u00a0 Multiple new opportunities The future prospects of the employment market in India are highly encouraging, as evidenced by data from various sources. The Global Capability Centers (GCCs) in India have shown remarkable growth in recent years. The gig economy also promises significant increase in workforce in the country. Notably, the NITI Aayog report on gig economy projects a substantial increase in platform workers, which is expected to reach 2.35 crore (23.5 million) by 2029-30, underscoring the rapid expansion of the gig economy. The gig workers are expected to form 6.7% of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1% of the total livelihood in India by 2029-30. These developments collectively reflect India's robust economic trajectory and its potential to generate diverse employment opportunities. Data Credibility It is well known that the private data sources, which the report/media refers to as more reliable, has several shortcomings. These surveys use their own derived definition of employment \u2013 unemployment which is not aligned to either national or international standards. The sample distribution and methodology are often critiqued for not being as robust or representative as official data sources like PLFS. Therefore, reliance on such private data sources over official statistics can lead to misleading conclusions and thus, should be used with caution. Further, some authors use data selectively which undermines the credibility of their analysis and does not present an accurate picture of the employment scenario in India. Such reports fail to consider the positive trends and comprehensive data from official sources. Summary The official data sources like PLFS, RBI, EPFO, etc. show consistent improvements in the key labour market indicators, including increased Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) and Worker Population Ratio (WPR), and a declining Unemployment Rate during last five years. EPFO and NPS data further support the positive employment trends. The trends in manufacturing, expanding service sector, infrastructure growth, apart from others, including emerging opportunities in multiple sectors such as gig and platform economy and GCCs indicate robust future prospects. The Ministry of Labour and Employment emphasizes the credibility and comprehensiveness of official data, cautioning against the selective use of private data sources that can lead to misleading conclusions about India's employment scenario. The Government remains committed to creating a robust and inclusive job market, and the evidence suggests substantial progress is being made in this direction. ***** Pragya Paliwal Gaur / Himanshu Pathak (Release ID: 2031529) Visitor Counter : 4090 Read this release in: Urdu , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Marathi , Bengali , Punjabi , Gujarati , Tamil", "images": "there is no image for this article"},

Due to improved services, more establishments are surrendering their exemptions granted by EPFO. These establishments prefer to let EPFO manage their employees' Provident Fund (PF) directly. This allows them to focus on their core business activities. With faster claim settlement, higher rates of return, strong monitoring, and ease of engagement, services provided to both establishments and members by EPFO are continuously improving. EPFO, under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, has taken multiple steps in the last year to streamline compliance procedures for establishments exempted under the EPF Act. In an effort towards standardizing procedures, EPFO has, for the first time, published elaborate Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and manuals encompassing all procedures relevant for exempted establishments. Furthermore, in a major step towards digitization, a new software and portal will be launched shortly to simplify the process of surrendering exemptions. Establishments that wish to manage the PF corpus of their employees need to seek exemption under Section 17 of the EPF Act. This allows EPFO to permit them to manage their own PF Trust without making statutory contributions. Such exempted establishments are statutorily mandated to provide benefits that are at least on par with those provided by EPFO to subscribers and comply with the notified conditions of exemption as outlined in the Act. As of 31 st March 2023, there are 1002 exempted establishments managing a corpus of Rs. 3,52,000 crores of 31,20,323 members. The increasingly enhanced focus of EPFO on its stakeholders, along with professionally managed funds generating steady returns for members, has promoted the trend of surrendering exemptions. ***** Pragya Paliwal Gaur/ Himanshu Pathak (Release ID: 2033142) Visitor Counter : 1248 Read this release in: Urdu , Marathi , Hindi , Hindi_MP , Tamil , Telugu", "images": "there is no image for this article"},
